<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—WHAT IS COMING</h2>
<p>
“Will you do it?” asked the eager, black-eyed
girl sitting on the deep window shelf.
</p>
<p>
“If Mr. Hammond says the synopsis of the
picture is all right, I’ll go.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie! It would be just—just scrumptious!”
</p>
<p>
“<em>We’ll</em> go, Helen—just as we agreed last
week,” said her chum, laughing happily.
</p>
<p>
“It will be great! great!” murmured Helen
Cameron, her hands clasped in blissful anticipation.
“Right into the ‘wild and woolly.’ Dear
me, Ruth Fielding, we <em>do</em> have the nicest times—you
and I!”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t overlook me,” grumbled the third
and rather plump freshman who occupied the
most comfortable chair in the chums’ study in
Dare Hall.
</p>
<p>
“That would be rather—er—impossible,
wouldn’t it, Heavy?” suggested Helen Cameron,
rolling her black eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
Jennie Stone made a face like a street gamin,
but otherwise ignored Helen’s cruel suggestion.
“I’d rather register joy, too——Oh, yes, I’m
going with you; have written home about it.
Have to tell Aunt Kate ahead, you know. Yes,
I’d register joy, if it weren’t for one thing that
I see looming before us.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that, honey?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“The horseback ride from Yucca into the Hualapai
Range seems like a doubtful equation to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you mean ‘doubtful equestrianism’?”
put in the black-eyed girl with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I do,” sighed Jennie. “You know,
I’m a regular sailor on horseback.”
</p>
<p>
“You should have taken it up when we were
all at Silver Ranch with Ann Hicks,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, say not so!” begged Jennie Stone lugubriously.
“What I should have done in the past
has nothing to do with this coming summer. I
groan to think of what I shall have to endure.”
</p>
<p>
“Who will do the groaning for the horse that
has to carry you, Heavy?” interposed the irrepressible
Helen, giving her the old nickname that
Jennie Stone now scarcely deserved.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. Let the horse do his own worrying,”
was the placid reply. The temper of
the well nourished girl was not easily ruffled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Jennie, <em>think!</em>” ejaculated Helen, suddenly
turned brisk and springing down from the
window seat. “It will be just the jaunt for you.
The physical culturists claim there is nothing so
good for reducing flesh and helping one’s poor,
sluggish liver as horseback riding.”
</p>
<p>
“Say!” drawled the other girl, her nose tilted
at a scornful angle, “those people say a lot more
than their prayers—believe me! Most physical
culturists have never ridden any kind of horse
in their lives but a hobbyhorse—and they still
ride <em>that</em> when they are senile.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth applauded. “A Daniel come to judgment!”
she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” sniffed Jennie, suspiciously. “What
does that mean?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t just know myself,” confessed
Ruth. “But it sounds good—and Dr. Milroth
used it this morning in chapel, so it must be all
right.”
</p>
<p>
“Anything that our revered dean says goes big
with me, I confess,” said Jennie. “Oh, girls!
isn’t she just a dear?”
</p>
<p>
“And hasn’t Ardmore been just the delightsomest
place for nine months?” cried Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Even better than Briarwood,” agreed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“That sounds almost sacrilegious,” Helen observed.
“I don’t know about any place being
finer than old Briarwood.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s Ann!” cried Ruth in a tone that
made both the others jump.
</p>
<p>
“Where? Where?” demanded Helen, whirling
about to look out of the window again. The
window gave a broad view of the lower slope
of College Hill and the expanse of Lake Remona.
Dusk was just dropping, for the time
was after dinner; but objects were still to be
clearly observed. “Where’s Jane Ann Hicks?”
</p>
<p>
“Just completing her full course at Briarwood
Hall,” Ruth explained demurely. “She will go
to Montana, of course. But if I write her I
know she’ll join us at Yucca just for the fun of
the ride.”
</p>
<p>
“Some people’s idea of fun!” groaned Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“What are <em>you</em> attempting to go for, then?”
demanded Helen, somewhat wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Because I think it is my duty,” the plump
girl declared. “You young and flighty freshies
aren’t fit to go so far without somebody solid
along——”
</p>
<p>
“‘Solid!’ You said it!” scoffed Helen.
</p>
<p>
“I was referring to character, Miss Cameron,”
returned the other shaking her head. “But
Ann is certainly a good fellow. I hope she will
go, Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“I declare, Ruthie,” exclaimed her chum, “you
are getting up a regular party!”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
“It <em>will</em> be great fun,” acknowledged the black-eyed
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it will, goosie,” said Jennie Stone.
“Isn’t everything that Ruth Fielding plans always
fun? Say, Ruth, there are some girls right
here at Ardmore—and freshies, too—who would
be tickled to death to join us.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” objected Ruth, laughing at her
friend’s exuberance. “I wouldn’t wish to be the
cause of a general massacre, so perhaps we’d
better not invite any of the other girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Little Davenport would go,” Jennie pursued.
“She’s a regular bear on a pony.”
</p>
<p>
“Bareback riding, do you mean, Heavy?”
drawled Helen.
</p>
<p>
Except for a look, which she hoped was withering,
this was ignored by the plump girl, who went
on: “Trix would jump at the chance, Ruth. You
know, she has no regular home. She’s just
passed around from one family of relations to
another during vacations. She told me so.”
</p>
<p>
“Would her guardian agree?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing easier. She told me he wouldn’t
care if she joined that party that’s going to start
for the south pole this season. He’s afraid of
girls. He’s an old bachelor—and a misogynist.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” murmured Helen. “There
should be something done about letting such savage
animals be at large.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s no fun for poor little Trix,” said Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“She shall be asked,” Ruth declared. “And
Sally Blanchard.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” cried Helen. “She owns a horse,
and has been riding three times a week all this
spring. Her father believes that horseback riding
keeps the doctor away.”
</p>
<p>
“Improvement on ‘an apple a day keeps the
doctor away,’” quoted Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“How about eating an onion a day?” put in
Jennie. “That will keep everybody away!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Jennie, we’re not getting anywhere!”
declared Helen Cameron. “<em>Are</em> you going to invite
a bunch of girls, Ruth, to go West with us?”
</p>
<p>
This is how the idea germinated and took root.
Ruth and Helen had talked over the possibility
of making the trip into the Hualapai Range for
more than a fortnight; but nothing had as yet
been planned in detail.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammond, president of the Alectrion
Film Corporation had conceived the idea of a
spectacular production on the screen of “The
Forty-Niners”—as the title implied, a picture of
the early gold digging in the West. He had
heard of an abandoned mining camp in Mohave
County, Arizona, which could easily and cheaply
be put into the condition it was before its inhabitants
stampeded for other gold diggings.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammond desired to have most of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
scenes taken at Freezeout Camp and he had
talked over the plot of the story with Ruth Fielding,
whose previous successes as a scenario writer
were remarkable. The producer wished, too, that
Ruth should visit the abandoned mining camp
to get her “local color” and to be on the scene
when his company arrived to make the films.
</p>
<p>
There was a particular reason, too, why Ruth
had a more than ordinary interest in this proposed
production. Instead of being paid outright
for her work as the writer of the scenario, some
of her own money was to be invested in the picture.
Having taken up the making of motion
pictures seriously and hoping to make it her livelihood
after graduating from college, Ruth wished
her money as well as her brains to work for her.
</p>
<p>
Nor was the president of the Alectrion Film
Corporation doing an unprecedented thing in
making this arrangement. In this way the shrewd
capitalists behind the great film-making companies
have obtained the best work from chief directors,
the most brilliant screen stars, and the more successful
scenario writers. To give those who
show special talent in the chief departments of
the motion picture industry a financial interest in
the work, has proved gainful to all concerned.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had walked slowly to the window, and
she stood a moment looking out into the warm
June dusk. The campus was deserted, but lights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
glimmered everywhere in the windows of the
Ardmore dormitories. This was the evening
before Commencement Day and most of the
seniors and juniors were holding receptions, or
“tea fights.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think, girls?” Ruth said thoughtfully.
“Of course, we’ll have to have the guide
Mr. Hammond spoke about, and a packtrain
anyway. And the more girls the merrier.”
</p>
<p>
“Bully!” breathed the slangy Miss Stone, wiggling
in her chair.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I vote we do, Ruth. Have ’em all meet
at Yucca and——”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Ruth cried out and sprang back from
the window.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, dear?” asked Helen, rushing
over to her and seizing her chum’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“What bit you, Ruth Fielding? A mosquito?”
demanded Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“Sh! girls,” breathed the girl of the Red Mill
softly. “There’s somebody just under this window—on
the ledge!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—EAVESDROPPING</h2>
<p>
Helen tiptoed to the window and peered out
suddenly. She expected to catch the eavesdropper,
but——
</p>
<p>
“Why, there’s nobody here, Ruth,” she complained.
</p>
<p>
“No-o?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a soul. The ledge is bare away to the
end. You—you must have been mistaken, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth looked out again and Jennie Stone
crowded in between them, likewise eager to see.
</p>
<p>
“I know there was a girl there,” whispered
Ruth. “She lay right under this window.”
</p>
<p>
“But what for? Trying to scare us?” asked
Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Trying to break her own neck, I should
think,” sniffed Jennie. “Who’d risk climbing
along this ledge?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> have,” confessed Helen. “It’s not such a
stunt. Other girls have.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“But <em>why?</em>” demanded the plump freshman.
“What was she here for?”
</p>
<p>
“Listening, I tell you,” Helen said.
</p>
<p>
“To what? We weren’t discussing buried
treasure—or even any personal scandal,” laughed
Jennie. “What do you think, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“That is strange,” murmured the girl of the
Red Mill reflectively.
</p>
<p>
“The strangest thing is where she could have
gone so quickly,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! around the corner—the nearest corner,
of course,” observed Jennie with conviction.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I didn’t think of that,” cried Ruth, and
went to the other window, for the study shared
during their freshman year by her and Helen
Cameron was a corner room with windows looking
both west and south.
</p>
<p>
When the trio of puzzled girls looked out of
the other open window, however, the wide ledge
of sandstone which ran all around Dare Hall
just beneath the second story windows was deserted.
</p>
<p>
“Who lives along that way?” asked Jennie,
meaning the occupants of the several rooms the
windows of which overlooked the ledge on the
west side of the building.
</p>
<p>
“Why—May MacGreggor for one,” said
Helen. “But it wouldn’t be May. She’s not
snoopy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“I should say not! Nor is Rebecca Frayne,”
Ruth said. “She has the fifth room away. And
girls! I believe Rebecca would be delighted to go
with us to Arizona.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—well——Could she go?” asked Helen
pointedly.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. Maybe it can be arranged,” Ruth
said reflectively.
</p>
<p>
She seemed to wish to lead the attention of
the other two from the mystery of the girl she
had observed on the ledge. But Helen, who
knew her so well, pinched Ruth’s arm and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“I believe you know who it was, Ruthie Fielding.
You can’t fool me.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” admonished her friend, and because
Ruth’s influence was very strong with the black-eyed
girl, the latter said no more about the mystery
just then.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding’s influence over Helen had begun
some years before—indeed, almost as soon as
Ruth herself, a heart-sore little orphan, had arrived
at the Red Mill to live with her Uncle Jabez
and his little old housekeeper, Aunt Alvirah, “who
was nobody’s relative, but everybody’s aunt.”
</p>
<p>
Helen and her twin brother, Tom Cameron,
were the first friends Ruth made, and in the first
volume of this series of stories, entitled, “Ruth
Fielding of the Red Mill,” is related the birth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
growth of this friendship. Ruth and Helen go to
Briarwood Hall for succeeding terms until they
are ready for college; and their life there and their
adventures during their vacations at Snow Camp,
at Lighthouse Point, at Silver Ranch, at Cliff Island,
at Sunrise Farm, with the Gypsies, in Moving
Pictures and Down in Dixie are related in
successive volumes.
</p>
<p>
Following this first vacation trip Ruth and
Helen, with their old chum Jennie Stone, entered
Ardmore College, and in “Ruth Fielding at College;
Or, The Missing Examination Papers,” the
happenings of the chums’ freshman year at this
institution for higher education are narrated.
</p>
<p>
The present story, the twelfth of the series,
opens during the closing days of the college year.
Ruth’s plans for the summer—or for the early
weeks of it at least—are practically made.
</p>
<p>
The trip West, into the Hualapai Range of Arizona
for the business of making a moving picture
of “The Forty-Niners” had already stirred the
imagination of Ruth and her two closest friends.
But the idea of forming a larger party to ride
through the wilds from Yucca to Freezeout Camp
was a novel one.
</p>
<p>
“It will be great fun,” said Helen again. “Of
course, old Tom will go along anyway——”
</p>
<p>
“To chaperon us,” giggled Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“No. To see we don’t fall out of our saddles,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
Ruth laughed. “Now! let’s think about it, girls,
and decide on whom we shall invite.”
</p>
<p>
“Trix and Sally,” Jennie said.
</p>
<p>
“And Ann Hicks!” cried Helen. “You write
to her, Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“I will to-night,” promised her chum. “And
I’m going to speak to Rebecca Frayne at once.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see Beatrice,” stated Jennie, moving toward
the door.
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll run and ask Sally. She’s a good old
scout,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
But as soon as the plump girl had departed,
Helen flung herself upon Ruth. “Who was she?
Tell me, quick!” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“The girl under that window?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. You know, Ruthie.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I suspect,” her chum said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me!”
</p>
<p>
“Edie Phelps.”
</p>
<p>
“There!” exclaimed Helen, her black eyes
fairly snapping with excitement. “I thought so.”
</p>
<p>
“You did?” asked Ruth, puzzled. “Why
should she be listening to us? She’s never shown
any particular interest in us Briarwoods.”
</p>
<p>
“But for a week or two I’ve noticed her hanging
around. It’s something concerning this vacation
trip she wants to find out about, I believe.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, how odd!” Ruth said. “I can’t understand
it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish we’d caught her,” said Helen, sharply,
for she did not like the sophomore in question.
Edith Phelps had been something of a “thorn in
the flesh” to the chums during their freshman year.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know,” Ruth murmured. “It
would only have brought on another quarrel with
her. We’d better ignore it altogether I think.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” sniffed Helen. “That doesn’t satisfy
my curiosity; and I’m frank to confess that
I’m bitten deep by <em>that</em> microbe.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh well, my dear,” said Ruth, teasingly,
“there are many things in this life it is better you
should not know. Ahem! I’m going to see Rebecca.”
</p>
<p>
Helen ran off, too, to Sarah Blanchard’s room.
Many of the girls’ doors were ajar and there was
much visiting back and forth on this last evening;
while the odor of tea permeated every nook
and cranny of Dare Hall.
</p>
<p>
Rebecca’s door was closed, however, as Ruth
expected. Rebecca Frayne was not as yet socially
popular at Ardmore—not even among the girls
of her own class.
</p>
<p>
In the first place she had come to college with
an entirely wrong idea of what opportunities for
higher education meant for a girl. Her people
were very poor and very proud—a family of old
New England stock that looked down upon those
who achieved success “in trade.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
Had it not been for Ruth Fielding’s very good
sense, and her advice and aid, Rebecca could never
have remained at Ardmore to complete her freshman
year. During this time, and especially toward
the last of the school year, she had learned
some things of importance besides what was contained
within the covers of her textbooks.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth worried over the possibility that before
their sophomore year should open in September,
the influence at home would undo all the good
Rebecca Frayne had gained.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve just the thing for you, Becky!” Ruth
Fielding cried, carrying her friend’s study by
storm. “What do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Something nice, I presume, Ruth Fielding.
You always <em>are</em> doing something uncommonly kind
for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!”
</p>
<p>
“No nonsense about it. I was just wondering
what I should ever do without you all this long
summer.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it!” cried Ruth, laughing. “You’re
not going to get rid of me so easily.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Rebecca, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“That you’ll go with us. I need you badly,
Becky. You’ve learned to rattle the typewriter so
nicely——”
</p>
<p>
“Want me to get an office position for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
summer near you?” Rebecca asked, the flush rising
in her cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Better than that,” declared Ruth, ignoring Rebecca’s
flush and tone of voice. “You know, I told
you we are going West.”
</p>
<p>
“You and Cameron? Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And Jennie Stone, and perhaps others. But
I want you particularly.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth Fielding! I couldn’t! You know
just how <em>dirt poor</em> we are. It’s all Buddie can do
to find the money for my soph year here. No!
It is impossible!”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing is impossible. ‘In the bright lexicon
of youth,’ and so forth. You can go if you will.”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t accept such a great kindness, Ruth,”
Rebecca said, in her hard voice.
</p>
<p>
“Better wait till you learn how terribly kind I
am,” laughed Ruth. “I have an axe to grind, my
dear.”
</p>
<p>
“An axe!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeedy! I want you to help me. I
really do.”
</p>
<p>
“To <em>write?</em>” gasped Rebecca. “You know very
well, Ruth Fielding, that I can scarcely compose
a decent letter. I <em>hate</em> that form of human folly
known as ‘Lit-ra-choor.’ I couldn’t do it.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Ruth, smiling demurely. “I am
going to write my own scenario. But I will get a
portable typewriter, and I want you to copy my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
stuff. Besides, there will be several copies to
make, and some work after the director gets
there. Oh, you’ll have no sinecure! And if you’ll
go and do it, I’ll put up the money but you’ll be
paying all the expenses, Becky. What say?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew very well that if she had offered to
pay Rebecca a salary the foolishly proud girl
would never have accepted. But she had put it in
such a way that Rebecca Frayne could not but accept.
</p>
<p>
“You dear!” she said, with her arms about
Ruth’s neck and displaying as she seldom did the
real love she felt for the girl of the Red Mill.
“I’ll do it. I’ve an old riding habit of auntie’s
that I can make over. And of course, I can ride.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better make your habit into bloomers
and a divided skirt,” laughed Ruth. “That’s how
Jane Ann—and Helen and Jennie, too—will dress,
as well as your humble servant. There <em>are</em> women
who ride sidesaddle in the West; but they do not
ride into the rough trails that we are going to attempt.
In fact, most of ’em wear trousers outright.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! My aunt would have a fit,” murmured
Rebecca Frayne.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—THE LETTER FROM YUCCA</h2>
<p>
Before Dare Hall was quiet that night it was
known throughout the dormitory that six girls of
the freshman class were going to spend a part of
the summer vacation in the wilds of Arizona.
</p>
<p>
“Like enough we’ll never see any of them
again,” declared May MacGreggor. “The female
of the species is scarce in ‘them parts,’ I
understand. They will all six get married to cowboys,
or gold miners, or——”
</p>
<p>
“Or movie actors,” snapped Edith Phelps, with
a toss of her head. “I presume Fielding is quite
familiar with any quantity of ‘juvenile leads’ and
‘stunt’ actors as well as ‘custard-pie comedians.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, behave, Edie!” chuckled the Scotch girl.
“I’d love to go with ’em myself, but I must help
mother take care of the children this summer.
There’s a wild bunch of ‘loons’ at my house.”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Helen Cameron did not hear
Edith’s criticism. Helen had a sharp tongue of
her own and she had no fear now of the sophomore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Indeed, both Ruth and Helen had quite
forgotten over night their suspicions regarding the
girl at their study window. They arose betimes
and went for a last run around the college grounds
in their track suits, as they had been doing for
most of the spring. The chums had gone in for
athletics as enthusiastically at Ardmore as they
had at Briarwood Hall.
</p>
<p>
Just as they set out from the broad front steps
of Dare and rounded the corner of the building
toward the west, Ruth stopped with a little cry.
There at her feet lay a letter.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody’s dropped a billet-doux,” said
Helen. “Or is it just an envelope?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth picked it up and turned it over so that
she could see its face. “The letter is in it,” she
said. “And it’s been opened. Why, Helen!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s for Edie Phelps.”
</p>
<p>
Helen had already glanced upward. “And
right under our windows,” she murmured. “I bet
she dropped it when——”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose she did,” said Ruth, as her chum’s
voice trailed off into silence. Suddenly Helen, who
was looking at the face of the envelope, gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” she exclaimed. “See the return address
in the corner?”
</p>
<p>
“Wha——Why, it says: ‘Box 24, R. F. D.,
Yucca, Arizona!’”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yucca, Arizona,” repeated Helen. “Just
where we are going. Ruth! there is something
very mysterious about this. Do you realize it?”
</p>
<p>
“It is the oddest thing!” exclaimed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Edith getting letters from out there and then
creeping along that ledge under our windows to
listen. Well, I’d give a cent to know what’s in that
letter.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Helen! We couldn’t,” cried Ruth,
quickly, folding the envelope and slipping it between
the buttons of her blouse.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” declared her chum, “she was
eavesdropping on us. We ought to be excused if
we did a little eavesdropping on her by reading her
letter.”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth set off immediately in a good, swinging
trot, and Helen had to close her lips and put
her elbows to her sides to keep up with her. Later,
when they had taken their morning shower and
had dressed and all the girls were trooping down
the main stairway of Dare Hall in answer to the
breakfast call, Ruth spied Edith Phelps and hailed
her, drawing the letter from her bosom.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, Edith Phelps! Here’s something that belongs
to you.”
</p>
<p>
The sophomore turned quickly to face the girl
of the Red Mill, and with no pleasant expression
of countenance. “What have you there?” she
snapped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“A letter that you dropped,” said Ruth, quietly.
</p>
<p>
“That <em>I</em> dropped?” and she came quickly to
seize the proffered missive. “Ha! I suppose you
took pains to read it?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth drew back, paling. The thrust hurt her
cruelly and although she would not reply, the
sophomore’s gibe did not go without answer.
Helen’s black eyes flashed as she stepped in front
of her chum.
</p>
<p>
“I can assure you Ruth and I do not read other
people’s correspondence any more than we listen
to other people’s private conversation, Phelps,”
she said directly. “We found that letter <em>under
our window where you dropped it last night!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Ruth caught at her arm; but the stroke went
home. Edith Phelps’ face reddened and then
paled. Without further speech she hurried away
with the letter gripped tightly in her hand. She
did not appear at breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“It’s terrible to be always ladylike,” sighed
Helen to Ruth. “I just <em>know</em> we have seen one
end of a mystery. And that’s all we are likely to
see.”
</p>
<p>
“It is the most mysterious thing why Phelps
should be interested in our affairs, and be getting
letters from Yucca,” admitted Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The chums had no further opportunity of talking
this matter over, for it was at breakfast that
Rebecca Frayne threw her bomb. At least, Jennie Stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
said it was such. Rebecca came over
to Miss Comstock’s table where the chums and
Jennie sat and demanded:
</p>
<p>
“Ruth Fielding! who is going to chaperon your
party?”
</p>
<p>
“What? Chaperon?” murmured Ruth, quite
taken aback by the question.
</p>
<p>
“Of course. You say Helen’s brother is going.
And there will be a guide and other men. We’ve
got to have a chaperon.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Helen. “Poor old Tommy! If
he knew that! He won’t bite you, Rebecca.”
</p>
<p>
“You girls certainly wouldn’t dream of going
on that long journey unless you were properly
attended?” cried Rebecca, horrified.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think we need?” demanded Jennie
Stone. “A trained nurse, or a governess?”
</p>
<p>
Rebecca was thoroughly shocked. “My aunt
would never hear of such a proceeding,” she affirmed.
“Oh, Ruth Fielding! I want to go with
you; but, of course, there must be some older
woman with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course—I presume so,” sighed Ruth. “I
hadn’t thought that far.”
</p>
<p>
“Whom shall we ask?” demanded Helen.
“Mrs. Murchiston won’t go. She’s struck. She
says she is too old to go off with any harum-scarum
crowd of school girls again.”
</p>
<p>
“I like that!” exclaimed Jennie, in a tone that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
showed she did not like it at all. “We have got
past the hobbledehoy age, I should hope.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Comstock, the senior at their table, had
become interested in the affair, and she suggested
pleasantly:
</p>
<p>
“We Ardmores often try to get the unattached
members of the faculty to fill the breach in such
events as this. Try Miss Cullam.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” muttered Helen.
</p>
<p>
Ruth said briskly, “Miss Cullam is just the person.
Do you suppose she has her summer free,
Miss Comstock?”
</p>
<p>
“She was saying only last evening that she had
made no plans.”
</p>
<p>
“She shall make ’em at once,” declared Ruth,
jumping up and leaving her breakfast. “Excuse
me, Miss Comstock. I am going to find Miss
Cullam, instantly.”
</p>
<p>
It was Miss Cullam, too, who had worried most
about the lost examination papers which Ruth had
been the means of finding (as related in “Ruth
Fielding at College”); and the instructor of mathematics
had taken a particular interest in the girl
of the Red Mill and her personal affairs.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t ridden horseback since I was a girl,”
she said, in some doubt. “And, my <em>dear!</em> you do
not expect me to ride a-straddle as girls do nowadays?
Never!”
</p>
<p>
“Neither will Rebecca,” chuckled Ruth. “But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
we who have been on the plains before, know that
a divided skirt is a blessing to womankind.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not think I shall need that particular
blessing,” Miss Cullam said, rather grimly. “But
I believe I will accept your invitation, Ruth Fielding.
Though perhaps it is not wise for instructors
and pupils to spend their vacations together. The
latter are likely to lose their fear of us——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Cullam! There isn’t one of us who
has a particle of fear of you,” laughed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Ahem! that is why some of you do not stand
so well in mathematics as you should,” said the
teacher dryly.
</p>
<p>
That was a busy day; but the party Ruth was
forming made all their plans, subject, of course,
to agreement by their various parents and guardians.
In one week they were to meet in New York,
prepared to make the long journey by train to
Yucca, Arizona, and from that point into the
mountains on horseback.
</p>
<p>
Helen found time for a little private investigation;
but it was not until she and Ruth were on the
way home to Cheslow in the parlor car that she
related her meager discoveries to her chum.
</p>
<p>
“What did you ever learn about Edie Phelps?”
Helen asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Edie? I had forgotten about her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I didn’t forget. The mystery piques
me, as the story writers say,” laughed Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
“Do you know that her father is an awfully rich
man?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no. Edith doesn’t make a point of telling
everybody perhaps,” returned Ruth, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“No; she doesn’t. You’ve got to hand it to her
for that. But, then, to blow about one’s wealth
is about as crude a thing as one can do, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what about Edith’s father?” asked
Ruth, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing particular. Only he is one of our
‘captains of industry’ that the Sunday papers tell
about. Makes oodles of money in mines, so I was
told. Edith has no mother. She had a
brother——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! is he dead?” cried Ruth, with sympathy.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he’d better be. He was rusticated
from his college last year. It was quite a scandal.
His father disowned him and he disappeared.
Edith felt awfully, May says.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad,” sighed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course, it’s too bad,” grumbled
Helen. “But that doesn’t help us find out why
Edie is so much interested in our going to Yucca;
nor how she comes to be in correspondence with
anybody in that far, far western town. What do
you think it means, Ruthie?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t the least idea,” declared the girl of
the Red Mill, shaking her head.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—A WEEK AT HOME</h2>
<p>
Mr. Cameron met the chums <em>en route</em>, and the
next morning they arrived at Seven Oaks in time
to see Tom receive his diploma from the military
and preparatory school. Tom, black-eyed and as
handsome in his way as Helen was in hers, seemed
to have interest only in Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! that boy’s got a regular crush
on you, Ruthie!” exclaimed Helen, exasperated.
“Did you ever see the like?”
</p>
<p>
“Dear Tom!” sighed Ruth Fielding. “He was
the very first friend—of my own age, I mean—that
I found in Cheslow when I went there. I
<em>have</em> to be good to Tommy, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“But he’s only a boy!” cried the twin sister,
feeling herself to be years older than her brother
after spending so many months at college.
</p>
<p>
“He was born the same day you were,” laughed
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“That makes no difference. Boys are never as
wise or as old as girls——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Until the girls slip along too far. Then they
sometimes want to appear young instead of old,”
said the girl of the Red Mill practically. “I suppose,
in the case of girls who have not struck out
for themselves and gone to college or into business
or taken up seriously one of the arts, it is so
the boys will continue to pay them attentions.
Thank goodness, Helen! you and I will be able
to paddle our own canoes without depending upon
any ‘mere male,’ as Miss Cullam calls them, for
our bread and butter.”
</p>
<p>
<em>“You</em> certainly can paddle your own boat,”
Helen returned admiringly, leaving the subject of
the “mere male.” “Father says you have become
a smart business woman already. He approves of
this venture you are going to make in the movies.”
</p>
<p>
But Uncle Jabez did not approve. Ruth had
written to Aunt Alvirah regarding the manner in
which she expected to spend the summer, and there
was a storm brewing when she reached the Red
Mill.
</p>
<p>
Set upon the bank of the Lumano River, the
old red mill with the sprawling, comfortable story-and-a-half
farmhouse attached, made a very pretty
picture indeed—so pretty that already one of
Ruth’s best scenarios had been filmed at the mill
and people all over the country were able to see
just how beautiful the locality was.
</p>
<p>
When Ruth got out of the automobile that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
brought them all from the Cheslow station and ran
up the shaded walk to the porch, a little, hoop-backed
old woman came almost running to the
door to greet her—a dear old creature with a face
like a withered russet apple and very bright, twinkling
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my pretty! Oh, my pretty!” Aunt Alvirah
cried. “I feared you never <em>would</em> come.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Auntie!” Ruth murmured, taking Aunt
Alvirah in her arms and leading her back to the
low rocking chair by the window where she usually
sat.
</p>
<p>
There was a rosy-cheeked country girl hovering
over the supper table, who smiled bashfully
at the college girl. Uncle Jabez, as he had promised,
had hired somebody to relieve the little old
woman of the heaviest of her housekeeping burdens.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!” groaned
Aunt Alvirah as she settled back into her chair.
“Dear child! how glad we shall be to have you at
home, if only for so short a while.”
</p>
<p>
“What does Uncle Jabez say?” whispered
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“He don’t approve, Ruthie. You know, he
never has approved of your doing things that other
gals don’t do.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Aunt Alvirah, other girls <em>do</em> do them.
Can’t he understand that the present generation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
girls is different from his mother’s generation?”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Alvirah wagged her head seriously. “I’m
afraid not, my pretty. Jabez Potter ain’t one to
l’arn new things easy. You know that.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth nodded thoughtfully. She expected a
scene with the old miller and she was not disappointed.
It came after supper—after Uncle Jabez
had retired to the sitting-room to count his day’s
receipts as usual; and likewise to count the hoard
of money he always kept in his cash-box.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez Potter was of a miserly disposition.
Aunt Alvirah often proclaimed that the
coming of his grand-niece to the Red Mill had
barely saved the old man from becoming utterly
bound up in his riches. Sometimes Ruth could
scarcely see how he could have become more miserly
than he already was.
</p>
<p>
“No, Niece Ruth, I don’t approve. You
knowed I couldn’t approve of no sech doin’s as
this you’re attemptin’. It’s bad enough for a gal
to waste her money in l’arnin’ more out o’ books
than what a man knows. But to go right ahead
and do as she plumb pleases with five thousand
dollars—or what ye’ve got left of it after goin’
off to college and sech nonsense. No——”
</p>
<p>
The miller’s feelings on the subject were too
deep for further utterance. Ruth said, firmly:
</p>
<p>
“You know, Uncle Jabez, the money was given
to me to do what I pleased with.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
“Another foolish thing,” snarled Uncle Jabez.
“That Miz Parsons had no business to give ye
five thousand dollars for gettin’ back her necklace
from the Gypsies—a gal like you!”
</p>
<p>
“But she had offered the reward to anybody
who would find it,” Ruth explained patiently.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Jabez ploughed right through this statement
and shook his head like an angry bull. “And
then the court had no business givin’ it over to
Mister Cameron to take care on’t for ye. <em>I</em> was
the proper person to be made your guardeen.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had no reply to make to this. She knew
well enough that she would never have touched
any of the money until she was of age had Uncle
Jabez once got his hands upon it.
</p>
<p>
“The money’s airnin’ ye good int’rest in the
Cheslow bank. That’s where it oughter stay.
Wastin’ it makin’ them foolish movin’ pictuers——”
</p>
<p>
“But, Uncle!” she told him desperately; “you
know that my scenarios are earning money. See
how much money my ‘Heart of a Schoolgirl’ has
made for the building of the new dormitory at
Briarwood. And this last picture that Mr. Hammond
took here at the mill is bound to sell big.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted the miller, not much impressed.
“Mebbe it’s all right for you to spend your spare
time writin’ them things; but it ain’t no re’l business.
Can’t tell me!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“But it <em>is</em> a business—a great, money-making
business,” sighed Ruth. “And I am determined
to have my part in it. It is my chance, Uncle
Jabez—my chance to begin something lasting——”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense! Nonsense!” he declared angrily.
“Ye’ll lose your money—that’s what ye’ll do. But
lemme tell you, young lady, if you do lose it, don’t
ye come back here to the Red Mill expectin’ me ter
support ye in idleness. For I won’t do it—I won’t
do it!” and he stamped away to bed.
</p>
<p>
The few days she spent at home were busy ones
for Ruth Fielding. Naturally, she and Helen had
to do some shopping.
</p>
<p>
“For even if we are bound for the wilds of Arizona,
there will be men to see us,” said the black-eyed
girl frankly. “And it is the duty of all females
to preen their feathers for the males.”
</p>
<p>
“Just so,” growled her twin. “I expect I shall
have to stand with a gun in both hands to keep
those wild cowpunchers and miners away from you
two when we reach Yucca. I remember how it
was at Silver Ranch—and you were only kids
then.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Kids,’ forsooth!” cried his sister. “When
will you ever learn to have respect for us, Tommy?
Remember we are college girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you aren’t likely to let anybody forget that
fact,” grumbled Tom, who felt a bit chagrined to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
think that his sister and her chum had arrived at
college a year ahead of him. He would enter
Harvard in the fall.
</p>
<p>
During this busy week, Ruth spent as much time
as possible with Aunt Alvirah, for the little old
woman showed that she longed for “her pretty’s”
company. Uncle Jabez went about with a thundercloud
upon his face and disapproval in his
every act and word.
</p>
<p>
Before Saturday a telegram came from Ann
Hicks. She had arrived at Silver Ranch, conferred
with Uncle Bill, and it was agreed that she
should meet Ruth and the other girls at Yucca on
the date Ruth had named in her letter. The addition
of Ann to the party from the East would
make it nine strong, including Miss Cullam as
chaperon and Tom Cameron as “courier.”
</p>
<p>
Tom was to make all the traveling arrangements,
and he went on to New York a day before
Ruth and Helen started from Cheslow. There he
had a small experience which afterward proved to
be important. At the time it puzzled him a good
deal.
</p>
<p>
It had been agreed that the party bound for
Arizona should meet at the Delorphion Hotel.
Therefore, Tom took a taxicab at the Grand Central
Terminal for that hostelry. Mr. Cameron
had engaged rooms for the whole party by telephone,
for he was well known at the Delorphion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
and all Tom had to do was to hand the clerk at
the desk his card and sign his name with a flourish
on the register.
</p>
<p>
The instant he turned away from the desk to
follow the bellhop Tom noted a young man, after
a penetrating glance at him, slide along to the register,
twirl it around again, and examine the line
he, Tom, had written there. The young fellow
was a stranger to Tom. He was dressed like a
chauffeur. Tom was sure he had never seen the
young man before.
</p>
<p>
“Now, wouldn’t that bother you?” he muttered,
eyeing the fellow sharply as he crossed the
marble-floored rotunda to the elevators. “Does
he think he knows me? Or is he looking for somebody
and is putting every new arrival through the
third degree?”
</p>
<p>
He half expected the chauffeur person to follow
him to the elevator, and he lingered behind the impatient
bellhop for half a minute to give the
stranger a chance to accost him if he wished to.
</p>
<p>
But immediately after the fellow had read
Tom’s name on the book, he turned away and
went out, without vouchsafing him another glance.
</p>
<p>
“Funny,” thought Tom Cameron. “Wonder
what it means.”
</p>
<p>
However, as nothing more came of it—at least,
not at once—he buried the mystery under the manifold
duties of the day. He met a couple of school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
friends at noon and went to lunch with them; but
he returned to the hotel for dinner.
</p>
<p>
It was then he spied the same chauffeur again.
He was helping a young lady out of a private car
before the hotel entrance and a porter was going
in ahead with two big traveling bags.
</p>
<p>
Tom was sure it was the same man who had examined
the hotel register after he had signed his
name; and he was tempted to stop and speak to
him. But the young lady whisked into the hotel
without his seeing her face, while the chauffeur,
after a curious, straight stare at Tom, jumped into
the car and started away. Tom noticed that there
was a monogram upon the motor-car door, but he
did not notice the license number.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the girl is one of those going with us,”
Tom thought, as he went inside.
</p>
<p>
The porter with the bags and the young lady in
question has disappeared. He went to the desk
and asked the clerk if any of his party had arrived
and was informed to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it gets me,” ruminated Tom, as he went
up to dress for dinner. “I don’t know whether I
am the subject of a strange young lady’s attentions,
or merely if the chauffeur was curious about
me. Guess I won’t say anything to the girls about
it. Helen would surely give me the laugh.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—THE GIRL IN LOWER FIVE</h2>
<p>
Tom and his father had visited his sister and
Ruth at Ardmore; the young fellow was no
stranger to the girls whom Ruth had invited to
join the party bound for Freezeout Camp. Of
course, Jennie Stone knew Helen’s black-eyed twin
from old times when they were children.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, how you’ve grown, Tommy!” observed
the plump girl, looking Tom over with approval.
</p>
<p>
“For the first time since I’ve known you, Jennie,
I cannot return the compliment,” Tom said
seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Gee!” sighed the erstwhile fat girl, ecstatically,
“am I not glad!”
</p>
<p>
That next day all arrived. Ruth and Helen
were the last, they reaching the hotel just before
bedtime. But Tom was forever wandering
through the foyer and parlors to spy a certain hat
and figure that he was sure he should know again.
He was tempted to tell Helen and her chums about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
the chauffeur and the strange young lady while
they were all enjoying a late supper.
</p>
<p>
“However, a man alone, with such a number of
girls, has to be mighty careful,” so Tom told himself,
“that they don’t get something on him.
They’d rig me to death, and I guess Tommy had
better keep his tongue between his teeth.”
</p>
<p>
The train on which the party had obtained reservations
left the Pennsylvania Station at ten
o’clock in the forenoon. Half an hour before that
time Tom came down to the hotel entrance ahead
of the girls and instructed the starter to bespeak
two taxicabs.
</p>
<p>
As Tom stepped out of the wide open door he
saw the motor-car with the monogram on the door,
the same chauffeur driving, and the girl with the
“stunning” hat in the tonneau. The car was just
moving away from the door and it was but a fleeting
glimpse Tom obtained of it and its occupants.
They did not even glance at him.
</p>
<p>
“Guess I was fooling myself after all,” he muttered.
“At any rate, I fancy they aren’t so greatly
interested. They’re not following us, that’s sure.”
</p>
<p>
The girls came hurrying down, with Miss Cullam
in tow, all carrying their hand baggage.
Trunks had gone on ahead, although Ruth had
warned them all that, once off the train at Yucca,
only the most necessary articles of apparel could
be packed into the mountain range.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“Remember, we are dependent upon burros for
the transportation of our luggage; and there are
only just about so many of the cunning little things
in all Arizona. We can’t transport too large a
wardrobe.”
</p>
<p>
“Are the burros as cunning as they say they
are?” asked Trix Davenport.
</p>
<p>
“All of that,” said Tom. “And great singers.”
</p>
<p>
“Sing? Now you are spoofing!” declared the
coxswain of Ardmore’s freshman eight.
</p>
<p>
“All right. You wait and see. You know what
they call ’em out there? Mountain canaries.
Wait till you hear a love-lorn burro singing to his
mate. Oh, my!”
</p>
<p>
“The idea!” ejaculated Miss Cullam. “What
does the boy mean by ‘love-lorn’?”
</p>
<p>
It was a hilarious party that alighted from the
taxicabs in the station and made its way to the
proper part of the trainshed. The sleeping car
was a luxurious one, and when the train pulled out
and dived into the tunnel under the Hudson (“just
like a woodchuck into its hole,” Trix said) they
were comfortably established in their seats.
</p>
<p>
Tom had secured three full sections for the
girls. Miss Cullam had Lower Two while Tom
himself had Upper Five. There was some slight
discussion over this latter section, for the berth
under Tom had been reserved for a lady.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s all right,” said Tom philosophically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
“If she can stand it, <em>I</em> can. Let the conductor
fight it out with her.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps she will want you to sleep out on the
observation platform, Tommy,” said Jennie Stone,
wickedly. “To be gallant you’d do it, of course?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Tom, stoutly. “Far be it
from me to add to the burden on the mind of any
female person. It strikes me that they are mostly
in trouble about something all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” cried Helen. “Villain! Is that the
way I’ve brought you up?”
</p>
<p>
Tom grinned at his sister wickedly. “Somehow
your hand must have slipped when you were
molding me, Sis. What d’you think?”
</p>
<p>
When the time came to retire, however, there
was no objection made by the lady who had reserved
Lower Five. Of course, in these sleeping
cars the upper and lower berths were so arranged
that they were entirely separate. But in the
morning Tom chanced to be coming from his
berth just as the lady started down the corridor
for the dressing room.
</p>
<p>
“My!” thought Tom. “That’s some pretty
girl. Who——”
</p>
<p>
Then he caught a glimpse of her face, just as
she turned it hastily from him. He had seen it
once before—just as a certain motor-car was
drawing away from the front of the Delorphion
Hotel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“No use talking,” he thought. “I’ve got to
take somebody into my confidence about this girl.
To keep such a mystery to myself is likely to affect
my brain. Humph! I’ll tell Ruth. She can
keep a secret—if she wants to,” and he went off
whistling to the men’s lavatory at the other end
of the car.
</p>
<p>
Later he found Ruth on the observation platform.
They were alone there for some time and
Tom took her into his confidence.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell Helen, now,” he urged. “She’ll
only rig me. And I’m bound to have a bad enough
time with all you girls, as it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor boy,” Ruth said, commiseratingly.
“You <em>are</em> in for a bad time, aren’t you? What
about this strange and mysterious female in Lower
Five?”
</p>
<p>
But as he related the details of the mystery,
about the chauffeur and all, Ruth grew rather
grave.
</p>
<p>
“As we go through to the dining car for breakfast
let us see if we can establish her identity,”
she told him. “Never mind saying anything to
the other girls about it. Just point her out to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! I’m not likely to spread the matter
broadcast,” retorted Tom. “Only I <em>am</em> curious.”
</p>
<p>
So was Ruth. But she bided her time and
sharply scrutinized every female figure she saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
in the cars as they trooped through to breakfast.
She waited for Tom to point out this “mysterious
lady;” but the girl of Lower Five did not appear.
</p>
<p>
The train was rushing across the prairies in
mid-forenoon when Tom came suddenly to Ruth
and gave her a look that she knew meant “Follow
me.” When she got up Jennie drawled:
</p>
<p>
“Now, see here, Ruthie! What’s going on between
that perfectly splendid brother of Cameron’s
and you? Are you trying to make the
rest of us girls jealous?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” Ruth replied, smiling, then hurried
with her chum’s brother into the next car.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Ruth suddenly, and she
stopped by the door.
</p>
<p>
“Know her?” asked Tom, with curiosity.
</p>
<p>
Ruth nodded and hastily turned away so that
the girl might not see that she was observed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now!” cried Tom. “Tip me off. Explain—elucidate—make
clear. I’m as puzzled as
I can be.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I, Tommy,” Ruth told him. “I haven’t
the least idea <em>why</em> that girl should be interested
in our affairs. And I’m not sure that she <em>is</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is she?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“She goes to college with us. Not in our
class, you understand. I am sure none of our
party had an idea Edie Phelps was going West
this vacation.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” said Tom suspiciously. “What’s up
your sleeve, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“My arm!” she cried, and ran back to the other
girls and Miss Cullam, laughing at him.
</p>
<p>
Edith’s presence on this train was puzzling.
</p>
<p>
“That was a man’s handwriting on the envelope
Helen and I picked up addressed to Edith,”
Ruth told herself. “Some man has been writing
to her from that Mohave County town. Who?
And what for?”
</p>
<p>
“Not that it is really any of my business,” she
concluded.
</p>
<p>
She did not take Helen into her confidence in
the matter. Let the other girls see Edith Phelps
if they chanced to; she determined to stir up no
“hurrah” over the sophomore.
</p>
<p>
Besides, it was not at all sure that Edith was
going to Arizona. Her presence upon this train
did not prove that her journey West had any connection
with the letter Edith had received from
Yucca.
</p>
<p>
“Why so serious, honey?” asked Helen a little
later, pinching her chum’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“This is a serious world, my dear,” quoth
Ruth, “and we are growing older every minute.”
</p>
<p>
“What novel ideas you do have,” gibed her
chum, big-eyed. But she shook her a little, too.
“There you go, Ruthie Fielding! Always having
some secret from your owniest own chum.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“How do you know I have a secret?” smiled
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Because of the two little lines that grow deeper
in your forehead when you are puzzled or troubled,”
Helen told her, rather wickedly. “Sure
sign you’ll be married twice, honey.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t suggest such horrid possibilities,”
gasped the girl of the Red Mill in mock horror.
“Married twice, indeed! And I thought we had
both given up all intention of being wedded even
the <em>first</em> time?”
</p>
<p>
This chaff was all right to throw in Helen’s
eyes; but all the time Ruth expected one of the
party to discover the presence of Edith Phelps
on the train. She felt that with such discovery
there would come an explosion of some kind;
and she shrank from having any trouble with the
sophomore.
</p>
<p>
Of course, with Miss Cullam present, Edith
was not likely to display her spleen quite so
openly as she sometimes did when alone with the
other Ardmore girls. But Ruth knew Helen
would be so curious to know what Edith’s presence
meant that “the fat would all be in the fire.”
</p>
<p>
It was really amazing that Edith was not discovered
before they reached Chicago. After
that her reservation was in another car. Then on
the fifth night of their journey came something
that quite put the sophomore out of Ruth Fielding’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
mind, and out of Tom Cameron’s as well.
</p>
<p>
They had changed trains and were on the
trans-continental line when the startling incident
happened. The porter had already begun arranging
the berths when the train suddenly came to
a jarring stop.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” asked Miss Cullam of
the porter. She already had her hair in “curlers”
and was longing for bed.
</p>
<p>
“I done s’pect we broke in two, Ma’am,” said
the darkey, rolling his eyes. “Das’ jes’ wot it
seems to me,” and he darted out of the car.
</p>
<p>
There was a long wait; then some confusion
arose outside the train. Tom came in from the
rear. “Here’s a pretty kettle of fish,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Tommy?” demanded his sister.
</p>
<p>
“The train broke in two and the front end got
over a bridge here, and, being on a down grade,
the engineer could not bring his engine to a stop
at once. And now the bridge is afire. Come on
out, girls. You might as well see the show.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—SOMEBODY AHEAD OF THEM</h2>
<p>
Even Miss Cullam—in her dressing gown—trailed
out of the car after Tom. The sky was
alight from the blazing bridge. It was a wooden
structure, and burned like a pine knot.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the rolling cloud of smoke they could
see dimly the lamps of the forward half of the
train. The coupling having broken between two
Pullmans, the engine had attached to it only the
baggage and mail coaches, the dining car and one
sleeping car.
</p>
<p>
The other Pullmans and the observation coach
were stalled on the east side of the river.
</p>
<p>
“And no more chance of getting over to-night
than there is of flying,” a brakeman confided to
Tom and the girls. “That bridge will be a charred
wreck before midnight.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness me! What <em>shall</em> we do?” was
the cry. “Can’t we get over in boats?”
</p>
<p>
“Where will you get the boats?” sniffed Miss
Cullam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“And the water’s low in the river at this season,”
said the brakeman. “Couldn’t use anything
but a skiff.”
</p>
<p>
“What then?” Tom asked, feeling responsibility
roweling him. “We’re not destined to remain
here till they rebuild the bridge, I hope?”
</p>
<p>
“The conductor is wiring back for another engine.
We’ll pull back to Janesburg and from there
take the cross-over line and go on by the Northern
Route. It will put us back fully twelve hours,
I reckon.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-<em>night!</em>” exploded Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what does it matter?” asked Helen,
wonderingly. “We have all the time there is,
haven’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Presumably,” Miss Cullam said drily.
</p>
<p>
“But I telegraphed ahead to Yucca for rooms
at the hotel,” Tom explained, slowly, “and sent
a long message to that guide Mr. Hammond told
you about, Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Helen, giggling. “Flapjack
Peters—such a romantic name. Mr. Hammond
wrote Ruth that he was a ‘character.’”
</p>
<p>
“‘H. J. Peters,’” Tom read, from his memorandum.
“Yes. I told him just when we would
arrive and told him that after one night’s sleep
at the hotel we’d want to be on our way. But if
we don’t get there——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom, there’s Ann, too!” Ruth exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
“She will be at Yucca too early if we are delayed
so.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll send some more telegrams when we get
to Janesburg,” Tom promised Ruth and his sister.
“One to Ann Hicks, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Those people in the forward Pullman will get
through on time,” Jennie Stone said. “I’m always
losing something. ‘’Twas ever thus, since
childhood’s hour, my fondest hopes I’ve seen decay,’
and so forth!”
</p>
<p>
Tom whispered to Ruth: “That sophomore
from Ardmore will get ahead of us. She’s in the
forward Pullman.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Edith!” murmured Ruth. “She was in
that car, wasn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
They were all in bed, as were the other tourists
in the delayed Pullmans, before the extra locomotive
the conductor had sent for arrived. It
was coupled to the stalled half of the train and
started back for Janesburg without one of the
party bound for Yucca being the wiser.
</p>
<p>
Tom Cameron meant to send the supplementary
telegrams from that junction as he had said. Indeed,
he had written out several—one to his father
to relieve any anxiety in the merchant’s mind
should he hear of the accident to their train; one
to the guide, Peters; one to Ann Hicks to supplement
the one already awaiting her at Yucca;
and a fourth to the hotel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
But as he wished to put these messages on the
wire himself, Tom did not entrust them to the
negro porter. Instead he lay down in his berth
with only his shoes removed—and he awoke in
the morning with the sun flooding the opposite
side of the car where the porter had already
folded up the berths!
</p>
<p>
“Good gracious, Agnes!” gasped Tom, appearing
in the corridor with his shoes in his hand.
“What time is it? Eight-thirty? Is my watch
right?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah reckon so, boss,” grinned the porter.
“‘Most ev’rybody’s up an’ dressin’.”
</p>
<p>
“And I wanted to send those telegrams from
Janesburg.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh Lawsy-massy! Janesburg’s a good ways
behint us, boss,” said the porter. “Ef yo’ wants
to send ’em pertic’lar from dere, yo’ll have to wait
till our trip East, Ah reckon.”
</p>
<p>
Tom did not feel much like laughing. In fact,
he felt a good deal of annoyance. He made some
further enquiries and discovered that it would be
an hour yet before the train would linger long
enough at any station for him to file telegrams.
</p>
<p>
They spent one more night “sleeping on
shelves,” as Jennie Stone expressed it, than they
had counted upon. Miss Cullam went to her
berth with a groan.
</p>
<p>
“Believe me, my dears,” she announced, “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
shall welcome even a saddle as a relief from these
cars. You are all nice girls, if I do say it, who
perhaps shouldn’t. I flatter myself I have had
something to do with molding your more or less
plastic minds and dispositions. But I must love
you a great deal to ever attempt another such
long journey as this for you or with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Cullam!” cried Trix Davenport,
“we will erect a statue to you on Bliss Island—right
near the Stone Face. And on it shall be
engraved: ‘Nor granite is more enduring than
Miss Cullam.’”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” murmured the teacher, “if that is
complimentary or otherwise?”
</p>
<p>
But they all loved her. Miss Cullam developed
very human qualities indeed, take her away
from mathematics!
</p>
<p>
The party was held up for two hours at Kingman,
waiting for a local train to steam on with
them to their destination. And there Tom learned
something which rather troubled him.
</p>
<p>
Telegrams were never received direct at Yucca.
The railroad business was done by telephone, and
all the messages sent to Yucca were telephoned
through to the station agent—if that individual
chanced to be on hand. Otherwise they were entrusted
to the rural mail carrier. One could almost
count the inhabitants of Yucca on one’s fingers
and toes!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jiminy!” gasped Tom, when he learned these
particulars. “I bet I’ve made a mess of it.”
</p>
<p>
He tried to find out at the Kingman station what
had become of the final messages he had sent.
The operator on duty when they arrived was now
off duty, and he lived out of town.
</p>
<p>
“If they were mailed, son,” observed the man
then at the telegraph table, “you will get to Yucca
about two hours before the mail gets there.
Here comes your train now.”
</p>
<p>
Had the girls not been so gaily engaged in chattering,
they must have noticed Tom’s solemn face.
He was disturbed, for he felt that the comfort of
the party, as well as the arrangements for the
trip into the hills, was his own particular responsibility.
</p>
<p>
It was late afternoon when the combination
local (half baggage and freight, and half passenger)
hobbled to a stop at Yucca. Besides a dusty
looking individual in a cap who served the railroad
as station agent, there was not a human being
in sight.
</p>
<p>
“What a jolly place!” cried Jennie Stone, turning
to all points of the compass to gaze. “So much
life! We’re going to have a gay time in Yucca,
I can see.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” begged Trix. “Don’t wake them up.”
</p>
<p>
“Awaken whom, my dear?” drawled Sally
Blanchard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“The dead, I think,” said Helen. “This place
must be the understudy for a graveyard.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment a gray muzzle was thrust between
the rails of a corral beside the track and
an awful screech rent the air, drowning the sound
of the locomotive whistle as the train rolled away.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake! what is that?” begged Rebecca,
quite startled.
</p>
<p>
“Mountain canary,” laughed Helen. “That is
what will arouse you at dawn—and other times—while
we are on the march to Freezeout.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean to say,” demanded Trix,
“that all that sound came out of that little creature?”
And she ran over to the corral fence the
better to see the burro.
</p>
<p>
“And he didn’t need any help,” drawled Jennie.
“Oh! you’ll get used to little things like
that.”
</p>
<p>
“Never to that little thing,” said Miss Cullam,
tartly. “Can’t he be muzzled?”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Tom had seized upon the station
agent. He was a long, lean, “drawly” man, with
seemingly a very languid interest in life.
</p>
<p>
“What telegrams?” he drawled.
</p>
<p>
Tom explained more fully and the man referred
to a memorandum book he carried in the breast
pocket of his flannel shirt.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. Three messages received over the ’phone
from Kingman station. All delivered.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good!” Tom exclaimed, with vast relief.
</p>
<p>
“Four days ago,” added the station agent.
</p>
<p>
That was a dash of cold water. “Didn’t you
receive other telegrams in the same way yesterday?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a one.”
</p>
<p>
“Where have they gone, then?”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t be here ’twixt eight and ‘leven.
They’d come over the wire to Kingman, and the
op’rator there would mail ’em. Mail man’s due
any time now.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” groaned Tom, “let’s go up to the hotel
and see if they’ve reserved the rooms for us, if
we are late.”
</p>
<p>
“And where’s Jane Ann Hicks?” queried Ruth,
in some puzzlement. “<em>She</em> ought to be here to
greet us.”
</p>
<p>
“What about that guide—the Flapjack person?”
added Helen. “Didn’t you telegraph him,
Tommy?”
</p>
<p>
“Who d’you mean—Flapjack Peters?” asked
the station agent, interested. “Why, he lit out
for some place in the Hualapai this forenoon,
beauin’ a party of these here tourists—or, so I
heard tell.”
</p>
<p>
There were blank faces among the newly arrived
visitors from the East. But only Tom Cameron
really felt disturbed. It looked to him as
though somebody had got ahead of them!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—A MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR</h2>
<p>
“You needn’t be ‘fraid of not findin’ room at
Lon Crujes’ hotel,” drawled the station agent.
“He don’t often have more’n two visitors at a
time there, and them’s mostly travelin’ salesmen.
Only when somebody’s shippin’ cattle. And there
ain’t no cattlemen here now.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that is some relief, at least,” Helen said
promptly. “Come on, Tommy! Lead the procession.
Take Miss Cullam’s bag, too. The rest
of us will carry our own.”
</p>
<p>
“How can we get the trunks up to the hotel?”
asked Ruth, beginning to realize that Tom, to
whom she had left all the arrangements, was in a
“pickle.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s see what the hotel looks like first,” returned
Helen’s twin, setting off along the dusty
street.
</p>
<p>
A dog barked at the procession; but otherwise
the inhabitants of Yucca showed a disposition to
remain incurious. It was not necessary to ask
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
the way to Lon Crujes’ hotel; it was the only building
in town large enough to be dignified by the
name of “Yucca House.”
</p>
<p>
A Mexican woman in a one-piece garment gathered
about her waist by a man’s belt from which
an empty gun-sheath dangled, met the party on
the porch of the house. She seemed surprised to
see them.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t them folks that telegraphed Lon
you was comin’, are you?” she asked. “Don’t that
beat all!”
</p>
<p>
“I telegraphed ahead for rooms—yes,” Tom
said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the rooms is here all right—by goodness,
yes!” she said, still staring. Such an array
of feminine finery as the girls displayed had probably
never dawned upon Mrs. Crujes’ vision before.
“Nobody ain’t run off with the rooms. We
ain’t never crowded none in this hotel, ‘cept in
beef shippin’ time.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, how about meals?” Tom asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
“If Lon gets home with a side of beef he went
for, we’ll be all right,” the woman said. “You
kin all come in, I reckon. But say! who was them
gals here yesterday, then, if ’twasn’t you.”
</p>
<p>
“What girls?” asked Ruth, who remained with
Tom to inquire.
</p>
<p>
“Have they gone away again?” demanded
Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“By goodness, yes! Two gals. One was tenderfoot
all right; but ‘tother knowed her way
’round, I sh’d say.”
</p>
<p>
“Ann?” queried Ruth of Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Must have been. But the other—Say, Mrs.
Crujes, tell us about them, will you, please?” he
asked the Mexican woman.
</p>
<p>
“Why, this tenderfoot gal dropped off the trans-continental.
Jest the train we expected you folks
on. I s’pose you was the folks we expected?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right. We’re the ones,” said Tom,
hastily. “Go on.”
</p>
<p>
“The other lady, <em>she</em> come later. She’s Western
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Ann is from Montana,” Ruth said, deeply interested.
</p>
<p>
“So she said. I reckoned she never met up
with the Eastern gal before, did she?”
</p>
<p>
“But who is the girl you speak of—the one from
the East?” gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Don’t you know her neither?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure I couldn’t guess,” Ruth declared.
Tom kept his lips tightly closed.
</p>
<p>
“They made friends, then,” explained the woman.
“The gal you say you know, and the tenderfoot.
And they went off together this morning
with Flapjack——”
</p>
<p>
“Not with our guide?” cried Ruth. “Oh, Tom!
what can it mean?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
“Got me,” grunted the young fellow.
</p>
<p>
“Why! it is the most mysterious affair,” Ruth
repeated. “I can’t understand it.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to me,” said Tom, quickly. “You
go in with the other girls and primp.”
</p>
<p>
“Primp, indeed!”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you’ll have to here, just the same
as anywhere else,” the boy said, with a quick grin.
“I’ll look around and see what’s happened. Of
course, that Flapjack person can’t have gone far.”
</p>
<p>
“And Ann wouldn’t have run away from us,
I’m sure,” Ruth sent back over her shoulder as
she entered the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Before the Mexican woman could waddle after
Ruth, Tom hailed her again. “Say!” he asked,
“where can I find this Peters chap?”
</p>
<p>
“The Señor Flapjack?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Fine name, that,” he added in an undertone.
</p>
<p>
“He it is who is famous at making the American
flapjack—<em>si si!</em>” said the woman. “But he
is gone I tell you. I know not where. Maybe
Lon, he can tell you when he come back with
the beef—by goodness, yes!”
</p>
<p>
“But he lives here in town, doesn’t he? Hasn’t
he a family?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sure! He’s got Min.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s Min? A Chinaman?”
</p>
<p>
“Chink? Can you beat it?” ejaculated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
woman, grinning broadly. “Min’s his daughter.
See that house down there with the front painted
yellow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” admitted Tom, rather abashed.
</p>
<p>
“That’s where Flapjack, he live. Sure! And
Min can tell you where he’s gone and how long
he’ll be away.”
</p>
<p>
The hotel proprietor’s wife disappeared, bustling
away to attend to the wants of this party
of guests that was apt to swamp her entire menage.
Tom hesitated about searching out the
guide’s daughter alone. “Min” promised embarrassing
possibilities to his mind.
</p>
<p>
“Jiminy! we’re up against it, I believe,” he
thought. “They’ll all blame me, I suppose. I
ought not to have gone to sleep night before last
and missed sending those last telegrams from
Janesburg.
</p>
<p>
“Father will say I wasn’t ‘tending to business
properly. I wonder what I’d better do.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth suddenly reappeared. She had merely
gone inside to get rid of her bag and assure Miss
Cullam that there were some matters she and
Tom had to attend to. Now she approached her
chum’s brother with a question that excited and
startled him.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun could have made her act
so, do you suppose, Tom?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? Who?” he gasped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“That girl. She’s gone off with our guide and
all.”
</p>
<p>
“Who do you mean? Jane Ann Hicks?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! I don’t understand Ann’s part in
it, either. But she’s not the leading spirit, it is
evident.”
</p>
<p>
“Who do you mean, then?” Tom demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Edith Phelps. Of course it is she. She arrived
here on the trans-continental train on time.
Tommy, she was in correspondence with somebody
here in Yucca. Helen and I saw the envelope.
And it puzzled us. Her being on the train
puzzled me more. And now——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Jiminy!” ejaculated Tom Cameron. “The
mystery deepens. Rival picture company, maybe,
Ruth. How about it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it’s <em>that</em>,” said Ruth Fielding,
reflectively. “I am sure Edie Phelps has no connection
with movie people—no, indeed!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—MIN</h2>
<p>
“Well, let’s go along and see Flapjack’s
daughter,” Tom proposed. “I don’t want to
make the acquaintance of any strange girl without
somebody to defend me,” and he grinned at
the girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. We know just how desperately timid
you are, Tommy-boy,” she told him, smiling. “I
will be your shield and buckler. Lead on.”
</p>
<p>
The house had a yellow front, but was elsewhere
left bare of paint. It stood away from its
neighbors and, as Ruth and Tom Cameron approached
it, it seemed deserted. From other
houses they were frankly watched by slatternly
women and several idle men.
</p>
<p>
Tom rapped gently at the front door. There
was no reply and after repeating the summons
several times Ruth suggested that they try a rear
entrance.
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” complained the boy. “This Min they
tell of must be deaf.”

</p>
<p>
“Or bashful. Perhaps she is nothing but a
child and is afraid of us.”
</p>
<p>
Tom merely grunted in reply, and led the way
into a weed-grown yard. The fence was of wire
and laths—the kind bought by the roll ready to
set up; but it was very much dilapidated. The
fence had never been finished at the rear and
up on a scrubby side hill behind the house a man
was wielding an axe.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he knows something about this Flapjack
Peters person,” grumbled Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Knock on the back door,” ordered Ruth Fielding
briskly. “If that guide has a daughter she
must know where he’s gone, and for how long.
It’s the most mysterious thing!”
</p>
<p>
“It gets me,” admitted Tom, knocking again.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Hammond said that he knew this guide
and that he believed he was a fairly trustworthy
person. He is what they call an ‘old-timer’—been
living here or hereabout for years and years. Just
the person to find Freezeout Camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, there must be other men who know their
way about the hills,” and Tom turned his back
to the door to look straight away across the valley
toward the faint, blue eminences that marked
the Hualapai Range.
</p>
<p>
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” sighed Ruth, likewise
looking at the mountains. “How clear the air is!
See that peak away to the north? We saw it from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
the car window. That is the tallest mountain
in the range—Hualapai Peak. Oh, Tom!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“That man looks awfully funny to me. Do
you see——?”
</p>
<p>
Tom wheeled to look at the person chopping
wood a few rods away. The woodchopper wore
an old felt hat; from underneath its brim flowed
several straggly locks of black hair.
</p>
<p>
“Must be an Indian,” muttered Tom.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a woman!” exclaimed Ruth. “It
is a woman, Tom! I’m going to ask her——”
</p>
<p>
“What?” demanded the youth; but he trailed
along behind the self-reliant girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
The woodchopper did not even raise her head
as the two young folks approached. She beat
upon the log she was splitting with the old axe
and showed not the least interest in their presence.
</p>
<p>
Ruth led the way around in front of her and
demanded:
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where Mr. Peters’ daughter is?
We had business with him, and they tell us he is
away from home.”
</p>
<p>
At that the woman in men’s shabby habiliments
raised her head and looked at them.
</p>
<p>
“Jiminy!” exploded Tom, but under his breath.
“It is a girl!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was quite as curious as her companion;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
but she was wise enough to reveal nothing in her
own countenance but polite interest.
</p>
<p>
The masquerader was both young and pretty;
only the perspiration had poured down her face
and left it grimy. Her hands were red and rough—calloused
as a laboring man’s and with blunted
fingers and broken nails.
</p>
<p>
When she stood up straight, however, even the
overalls and jumper she wore, and the broken old
hat upon her head, could not hide the fact that
she was of a graceful figure.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon,” said Ruth again. “Can
you tell me where Miss Peters is?”
</p>
<p>
“I can tell you where <em>Min</em> Peters is, if you
want to know so bad,” drawled the girl, red suffusing
her bronzed cheeks and a little flash coming
into her big gray eyes.
</p>
<p>
“That—that must be the person we wish to
see.”
</p>
<p>
“Then see her,” snapped the other ungraciously.
“An’ I s’pose you fancy folks think her a
sight, sure ’nuff.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean <em>you</em> are Mr. Peters’ daughter?”
Ruth asked, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Flapjack’s girl,” the other said, biting her
remarks off short.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Ruth. “Then you can tell us all
about it.”
</p>
<p>
“All about what?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“How it happens that your father is not here
at Yucca to meet us?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! What would he want to meet you for?”
asked the girl, shaking back her straggly hair.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it was arranged by Mr. Hammond that
Mr. Peters should guide us into the Range. We
are going to Freezeout Camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Wha-at?” drawled Min Peters in evident surprise.
“You, too?”
</p>
<p>
Tom here put in a word. “I am the one who
telegraphed to Mr. Peters when we were on the
way here. It was understood through Mr. Hammond
that Mr. Peters was to hold himself in
readiness for our party.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what about them other girls?” demanded
the girl, with sudden vigor. “They done fooled
pop, did they?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand what you mean by ‘those
other girls,’” Ruth hastened to say.
</p>
<p>
“Why, pop’s already started for the hills. I
I dunno whether he’s goin’ to Freezeout or not.
There ain’t nobody at that old camp, nohow.
Dunno what you want to go there for.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth waived that matter to say, eagerly:
</p>
<p>
“How many girls are there in this party your
father has gone off with?”
</p>
<p>
“Two. He ‘spected more I reckon, for there’s
a bunch of ponies down in Jeb’s corral. But the
girl that bossed the thing said you-all had backed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
out. It looked right funny to <em>me</em>—two girls goin’
off there into the hills. And she was a tenderfoot
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the girl who ‘bossed’ the affair?”
asked Tom, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. The other girl seemed jest driftin’ along
with her. <em>She</em> knowed how to ride, and she
brought her own saddle and rope with her. But
that there tenderfoot started off sidesaddle, like
a missioner.”
</p>
<p>
“A ‘missioner?’” repeated Ruth, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“These here women that sometimes come here
teachin’ an’ preachin’. They most all of ’em ride
sidesaddle. Many of ’em on a burro at that.
’Cause a burro don’t never git out of a walk if
he kin help it. But I’ve purty near broke my neck
teachin’ four or five of the ponies to stand for a
sidesaddle—poor critters. I rid ’em with a
blanket wrapped ’round me to git ’em used to a
skirt flappin’,” and she spoke in some amusement.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Ruth said, more briskly, “I don’t exactly
understand those girls going without us.
One of them I am sure is our friend. The girl
who evidently engaged your father is not a
stranger to us; but she was not of our party.”
</p>
<p>
“What in tarnation takes you ‘way into them
mountains to Freezeout?” demanded Min Peters.
“There ain’t a sign of color left there, so pop
says; and he’s prospected all through the range
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
on that far side. Why, he remembers Freezeout
when it was a real camp. And I kin tell you
there ain’t much left of it now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Ruth. “Have you seen it?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. I been all through the Range with pop.
He didn’t have nobody to leave me with when
I was little. I ain’t never had no chance like
other girls,” said Min, in no very pleasant tone.
“Why I ain’t scurcely human, I reckon!”
</p>
<p>
At that Ruth laughed frankly at her. “What
nonsense!” she cried. “You are just as human
and just as much of a girl as any of us. As I
am. Your clothes don’t even hide the fact that
you are a girl. But I suppose you wear them because
you can work easier in men’s garments?”
</p>
<p>
“And that’s where you s’pose mighty wrong,”
snapped Min.
</p>
<p>
“No?”
</p>
<p>
“I wear these old duds ’cause I ain’t got no
others to wear. That’s why.”
</p>
<p>
She said it in an angry tone, and the red flowed
into her cheeks again and her gray eyes flashed.
</p>
<p>
“I never <em>did</em> have nothin’ like other girls. Pop
bought me overalls to wear when I was jest a
kid; and that’s about all he ever did buy me. He
thinks they air good enough. I haf to work like
a boy; so why not dress like a boy? Huh?”
</p>
<p>
Tom had moved away. Somehow he felt a
delicacy about listening to this frank avowal of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
the strange girl’s trials. But Ruth was sympathetic
and she seized Min’s unwilling hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear!” she cried under her breath.
“I am sorry. Can’t you work and earn money
to clothe yourself properly?”
</p>
<p>
“What’ll I do? The cattlemen won’t hire me,
though I kin rope and hog-tie as well as any
puncher they got. But they say a girl would make
trouble for ’em. Nobody around here ever has
money enough to hire a girl to do anything. I
don’t know nothing about cookin’ or housework—‘cept
to make flapjacks. I kin do camp cookin’
as good as pop; only I don’t use two griddles at
a time same’s he does. But huntin’ parties won’t
hire me. It sure is tough luck bein’ a girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear!” cried Ruth again. “I don’t
believe that. There must be some way of improving
your condition.”
</p>
<p>
“You show me how to earn some money, then,”
cried Min. “I’ll dress as fancy as any of you.
Oh! I was watchin’ you girls troop up from the
train. And that other girl that went off with pop
this mornin’. <em>She</em> gimme a look, now I tell you.
I’d like to beat her up, I would!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth passed over this remark in silence. She
was thinking. “Wait a moment, Min,” she
begged, “I must speak to Mr. Cameron,” and
she led Tom aside.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Tommy, we’ve just got to get to Freezeout Camp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
some way. We don’t want to wait
here a week or more for the movie company to
arrive. Mr. Hammond expects me to have the
first part of the scenario ready for the director
when he gets on the ground. And I <em>must</em> see
the old camp just as it is.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know what that Edith Phelps has
got to do with it—and why Ann Hicks went off
with her,” growled Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Don’t you suppose I am just as
curious as you are?” Ruth demanded. “But <em>that</em>
doesn’t get us anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what will get us to Freezeout?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Getting started, first of all,” laughed Ruth.
“And we can do it. This girl can guide us just
as well as her father could. We can get a man
or a boy to look after the ponies and the packtrain.
A ‘wrangler’ don’t they call them on the
ranch?”
</p>
<p>
“The girl looks capable enough,” admitted
Tom. “But what will your Miss Cullam say to
her?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth giggled. “Poor Miss Cullam is doomed
to get several shocks, I am afraid, before the
trip is over.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. You’re the doctor,” Tom said,
grinning. “Looks to me like some lark. This
Min Peters is certainly a caution!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—IN THE SADDLE AT LAST</h2>
<p>
“The matter can be arranged in one, two,
three order!” Ruth cried.
</p>
<p>
She had already seen just the way to go about
it. Give Min Peters the chance to make money
and she would jump at it.
</p>
<p>
“You see, <em>we</em> don’t mind having a girl for cook
and guide. We will rather like it,” she said,
laughing into Min’s delighted face. “Poor old
Tom is our only male companion. And unless
we find a man to take care of the horses and burros
he’ll have to put on overalls himself and do
that work.”
</p>
<p>
“That’ll be all right. I can get a Mexican boy—a
good one,” Min said quickly. “The hosses
is all in Jeb’s corral and you can hire of him.
I tell you pop expected a big crowd of you and
he was disappointed.”
</p>
<p>
“You will make the money he would have
made,” Ruth told her cheerfully. “We will pay
you man’s wages and we shall want you at least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
a month. Eighty dollars and ‘found.’ How is
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Looks like heaven,” said Min bluntly. “I
ain’t never seen so much money in my life!”
</p>
<p>
“And the Mexican boy?”
</p>
<p>
“Pedro Morales. Twenty-two fifty is all he’ll
expect. We don’t pay Greasers like we do white
men in this country,” said the girl with some bruskness.
“But, say, Miss——”
</p>
<p>
“I am Ruth Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Fielding, then. You’re the boss of this
outfit?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so. I shall pay the bills at any
rate. Until Mr. Hammond and the moving picture
people arrive.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! what will them other girls say to me—dressed
this here way?”
</p>
<p>
“If you had plenty of dresses and were starting
into the range for a trip like this, you’d put
on these same clothes, wouldn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sure.”
</p>
<p>
“All right then. You’re hired to do a man’s
work, so I presume a man’s clothing will the better
become you while you are so engaged,” said
Ruth, smiling at her frankly.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Though they’ve got some calico
dresses at the store. I could buy one and wear
it—that is, if you’d advance me that much money.
But I got a catalog from a Chicago store—— Gee! it’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
full of the purtiest dresses. I <em>dreamed</em>
about gettin’ hold of some money some time and
buyin’ one o’ them—everything to go with it. But
to tell you honest, when pop gits any loose change,
he spends it for red liquor.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see that you have the money you are going
to earn, for yourself,” Ruth assured her. “Now
tell Mr. Cameron just what to buy. He will do
the purchasing at the store. And introduce him
to the Mexican boy, Pedro, too. I’ll run to tell
the other girls how lucky we are to get you to
help us, Min.”
</p>
<p>
She hurried away, in reality to prepare her
friends for the appearance of the girl who had
never worn proper feminine habiliments. She
knew that Min would not put up with any giggling
on the part of the “tenderfoot” girls. As for
Miss Cullam, that good woman said:
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I can stand overalls on a girl as well
as I can stand these divided skirts and bloomers
that some of you are going to wear.”
</p>
<p>
“Just think of a girl never having worn a pretty
frock!” gasped Helen. “Isn’t that outrageous!”
</p>
<p>
“The poor thing,” said Rebecca. “But she
must be awfully coarse and rough.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let her see that you think so, Rebecca,”
commanded Ruth quickly. “She has keener perceptions
than the average, believe me! We must
not hurt her feelings.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“Trust <em>you</em> not to hurt anybody’s feelings,
Ruthie,” drawled Jennie Stone. “But I might find
a dress in my trunk that will fit her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girls! let’s dress her up—let’s give her
enough of our own finery out of the trunks to
make her feel like a real girl.” This from Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Not now,” Ruth said quickly. “She would not
thank you. She is an independent thing—you’ll
see. Let her earn her new clothes—and get acquainted
with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Ruth possesses the ‘wisdom of serpents,’”
Miss Cullam said, smiling. “Are the trunks going
to remain here all the time we are absent in the
hills?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Hammond is going to have several wagons
to transport his goods to Freezeout; and if
there is room he will bring along our trunks too.
By that time we shall probably be glad to get into
something besides our riding habits.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Cullam sighed. “I can see that this
roughing it is going to be a much more serious
matter than I thought.”
</p>
<p>
However, they all looked eagerly forward to
the start into the hills. The hotelkeeper returned
with his horse-load of beef, and he was able to give
Ruth and Miss Cullam certain information regarding
the two girls who had departed with
Flapjack Peters on the trail to Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
“What can Edith Phelps mean by such actions?” the Ardmore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
teacher demanded in private
of Ruth. “You should have told me about that
letter and Edith’s presence on the train. I should
have gone to her and asked her what it meant.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that would have been well,” Ruth
admitted. “But, dear Miss Cullam! how was
I to know that Edith was coming here to Yucca?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I presume that the blame can be attached
to nobody in particular. But how could
Edith Phelps have gained the confidence of your
friend, Miss Hicks?”
</p>
<p>
“That certainly puzzles me. Edith made all
the arrangements with Min’s father, so Min says.
Ann Hicks must have been misled in some way.”
</p>
<p>
“It looks very strange to me,” observed Miss
Cullam. “I have my suspicions of Edith Phelps,
and always have had. There! you see that we
instructors at college cannot help being biased in
our opinions of the girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, Miss Cullam!” laughed Ruth.
“Isn’t that merely human nature? It is not alone
the nature of members of the college faculty.”
</p>
<p>
The hotel was a very plainly furnished place;
but the girls and Miss Cullam managed to spend
the night comfortably. At eight o’clock in the
morning Tom and a half-grown Mexican boy were
at the hotel door with a cavalcade of ten ponies
and four burros.
</p>
<p>
Tom had learned the diamond hitch while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
was at Silver Ranch and he helped fasten the
necessary baggage upon the four little gray beasts.
Each rider was obliged to pack a blanket-roll and
certain personal articles. But the bulk of the provisions,
and a small shelter tent for Miss Cullam,
were distributed among the pack animals.
</p>
<p>
The Briarwood girls and Trix Davenport rode
in men’s saddles; as did Min Peters; but Sally
Blanchard and Rebecca and Miss Cullam had insisted
upon sidesaddles.
</p>
<p>
“And the mildest mannered pony in the lot,
please,” the teacher said to Tom. “I am just as
afraid of the little beasts as I can be. Ugh!”
</p>
<p>
“And they are so cunning!” drawled Jennie.
She stepped quickly aside to escape the teeth of her
own mount, who apparently considered the possibility
of eating her so as not to bear her weight.
</p>
<p>
“And can you blame him?” demanded Helen.
“It would look better if you shouldered the pony
instead of riding on his back.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so? Just for that I’ll bear down as
heavily as I can on him,” declared Jennie. “I’m
not going to let any little cowpony nibble at me!”
</p>
<p>
The party started away from Yucca with Min
Peters ahead and Pedro bringing up the rear with
his burros. Although the ponies could travel at
a much faster pace than the pack animals, the
latter at their steady pace would overtake the cavalcade
of riders before the day was done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
The road they struck into after leaving town
was a pretty good wagon trail and the riding was
easy. There was an occasional ranch-house at
which the occupants showed considerable interest
in the tourists. But before noon they had ridden
into the foothills and Min told them that thereafter
dwellings would be few and far between.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ceptin’ where there’s a town. There are
some regular gold washin’s we pass. Hydraulic
minin’, you know. But they are all on this side
of the Range. Nothin’ doin’ on t’other side. All
the pay streaks petered out years an’ years ago.
Even a Chink couldn’t make a day’s wages at them
old diggin’s like Freezeout.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we are not gold hunting,” laughed Ruth.
“We are going to mine for a better output—moving
pictures.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard tell of them,” said Min, curiously.
“There was a feller worked for the Lazy C that
went to California and worked for them picture
fellers. He got three dollars a day and his pony’s
keep an’ says he never worked so hard in his life.
That is, when the sun shone; and it most never
does rain in that part o’ California, he says.”
</p>
<p>
The prospect of camping out of doors, even
in this warm and beautiful weather, was what
most troubled Miss Cullam and some of the girls.
</p>
<p>
“With the sky for a canopy!” sighed Sally
Blanchard. “Suppose there are wolves?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“There are coyotes,” Helen explained. “But
they only howl at you.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough I should hope,” Rebecca Frayne
said. “Can’t we keep on to the next house and
hire beds?”
</p>
<p>
This was along toward supper time and the
burros were in sight and the sun was going down.
</p>
<p>
“The nearest ranch is Littell’s,” explained Min
Peters. “And it’s most thirty mile ahead. We
couldn’t make it.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course it will be <em>fun</em> to camp out, Rebecca,”
declared Ruth cheerfully. “Wait and see.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m likely to know more about it by morning,”
admitted Rebecca. “I only hope the experience
will not be too awful.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth and her chum, as well as Jennie and Tom,
laughed at the girl. They expected nothing unusual
to happen. However——
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE STAMPEDE</h2>
<p>
Their guide was fully as capable as a man,
and proved it when it came to making camp. Her
selection of the camping site could not have been
bettered; she wielded an axe as well as a man in
cutting brush for bedding and wood for the fires.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Pedro and the burros arrived, Min
proceeded to get supper for the party with a skill
and celerity that reminded him, so Tom said, of
one of those jugglers in vaudeville that keep half
a dozen articles in the air at a time.
</p>
<p>
Min broiled bacon, made coffee, mixed and
baked biscuits on a board before the coals, and
finally made the popular flapjacks in unending
number—and attended to all these things without
assistance.
</p>
<p>
“Pop can beat me at flapjacks. Them’s his long
suit,” declared the girl guide. “Wait till you see
him toss ’em—a pan in each hand.”
</p>
<p>
Min’s viands could only be praised, and the
party made a hearty supper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
As dusk mantled them about, Tom suddenly
saw a spark of light out across the plain to the
south.
</p>
<p>
“What’s yonder?” he asked. “I thought you
said there was no house near here, Miss Peters?”
</p>
<p>
“Gee! if you don’t stop calling me <em>that</em>,” gasped
their guide, “I certainly will go crazy. I ain’t used
to it. But that ain’t a house.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, then?” asked the abashed Tom.
</p>
<p>
“One of the Lazy C outfits I reckon. Didn’t
you see the cattle grazin’ yonder when we come
over that last ridge?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! a regular herd of cattle such as you
read about?” demanded Sally Blanchard. “And
real cowboys with them?”
</p>
<p>
“I s’pect they think they’re real enough,” replied
Min, dryly. “Punchin’ steers ain’t no cinch,
lemme tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t she talk queerly?” said Rebecca, in
a whisper. “She really doesn’t seem to be a very
proper person.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” gasped Jennie Stone, choked
with laughter at this. “What do you expect of
a girl who’s lived in the mines all her life? Polite,
Back-Bay English and all the refinements of
the Hub?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” admitted Rebecca. “But, after all,
refined people are ever so much nicer than rude
people. Don’t you find it so yourself, Jennie?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, I s’pose that’s so,” admitted the plump
girl. “For a steady diet. Just the same, if you
judged it by its husk, you’d never know how sweet
the meat of a chestnut is.”
</p>
<p>
The campfire at the chuckwagon of the herding
outfit was several miles away; and later in the
evening it died down and the glow of it disappeared.
</p>
<p>
The girls were tired enough to seek repose
early. Min, Tom and the Mexican boy had agreed
to divide the night into three watches. Otherwise
Rebecca declared she would be afraid even to close
her eyes—and then her regular breathing announced
that sleep had overtaken her within sixty
seconds of her lying down!
</p>
<p>
Min chose the first watch and Ruth was not
sleepy. During the turns before midnight the
girl from the East and the girl who had lived a
boy’s life in the mining country became very well
acquainted indeed.
</p>
<p>
There had not been any “lucky strikes” in this
region since Min could remember. But now and
then new veins of gold were discovered on old
claims; or other metals had been discovered where
the early miners had looked only for gold.
</p>
<p>
“And pop’s an old-timer,” sighed Min. “He’ll
never be any good for anything but prospectin’.
Once it gets into a man, I reckon there ain’t no
way of his ever gettin’ away from it. Pop’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
panned for gold in three States; he’ll jest die a
prospector and nothin’ more.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s good of you to have stuck to him since
you grew big,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“What else could I do?” demanded the Western
girl. “Of course he loves me in his way;
and when he goes on his sprees he’d die some
time if I wasn’t on hand to nurse him. But some
day I’m goin’ to get a bunch of money of my
own—an’ some clo’es—and I’m goin’ to light out
and leave him where he lies. Yes, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not believe Min would do quite that;
and to change the subject, she asked suddenly:
</p>
<p>
“What’s that yonder? That glow over the
hill?”
</p>
<p>
“Moon. It’s going to be bright as day, too.
Them boys of the Lazy C will ride close herd.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know moonlight makes cattle right
ornery? The shadows are so black, you know.
Then, mebbe there’s something ‘bout moonlight
that affects cows. It does folks, too. Makes ’em
right crazy, I hear.”
</p>
<p>
“I have heard of people being moonstruck,”
laughed Ruth. “But that was in the tropics.”
</p>
<p>
“Howsomever,” Min declared, “it makes the
cows oneasy. See! there’s the edge of her. Like
silver, ain’t it?”
</p>
<p>
The moon flooded the whole plain with its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
beams as it rose from behind the mountains. One
might have easily read coarse print by its light.
</p>
<p>
Every bush and shrub cast a black reflection
upon the ground. It was very still—not a breath
of air stirring. Far, far away rose the whine of
a coyote; and the girls could hear one of the
herdsmen singing as he urged his pony around
and around the cattle.
</p>
<p>
“You hear ’em pipin’ up?” said Min, smiling.
“Them boys of the Lazy C know their business.
Singin’ keeps the cows quiet—sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
Their own fire died out completely. There was
no need for it. By and by Ruth roused Tom Cameron,
for it was twelve o’clock. Then both she
and Min crept into their own blanket-nests, already
arranged. The other girls were sleeping
as peacefully as though they were in their own
beds at Ardmore College.
</p>
<p>
Tom was refreshed with sleep and had no intention
of so much as “batting an eye.” The brilliancy
of the moonlight was sufficient to keep him
awake.
</p>
<p>
Yet he got to thinking and it took something of
a jarring nature to arouse him at last. He heard
hoarse shouts and felt the earth tremble as many,
many hoofs thundered over it!
</p>
<p>
Leaping up he looked around. Bright as the
moon’s rays were he did not at first descry the
approaching danger. It could not be possible that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
the cattle had stampeded and were coming up the
valley, headed for the tourists’ camp!
</p>
<p>
Yet that is what he finally made out. He
shouted to Pedro, and finally kicked the boy awake.
Without thinking of the danger to the girls Tom
believed first of all that their ponies and burros
might be swept away with the charging steers.
</p>
<p>
“Gather up those lariats and hold the ponies!”
Tom shouted to the Mexican. “The burros won’t
go far away from the horses. Hi, Min Peters!
What do you know about this?”
</p>
<p>
Their guide had come out of her blanket wide
awake. She appreciated the peril much more
keenly than did Tom or the girls.
</p>
<p>
“A fire! We want a fire!” she shouted. “Never
mind them ponies, Pedro! You strike a light!”
</p>
<p>
Up the valley came charging the forefront of
the cattle, their wicked, long horns threatening
dire things. As the Eastern girls awoke and saw
the cattle coming, they were for the most part
paralyzed with fear.
</p>
<p>
“Fire! Start a fire!” yelled Min, again.
</p>
<p>
The thunder of the hoofs almost drowned her
voice. But Ruth Fielding suddenly realized what
the girl guide meant. The cattle would not charge
over a fire or into the light of one.
</p>
<p>
She grabbed something from under her blanket
and leaped away from Miss Cullam’s tent toward
the stampede. Tom shouted to her to come back;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Helen groaned aloud and seized the sleepy Jennie
Stone.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be killed!” declared Helen.
</p>
<p>
“What’s Ruth doing?” gasped the plump girl.
</p>
<p>
Then Ruth touched the trigger of the big tungsten
lamp, and the spotlight shot the herd at
about the middle of its advance wave. Snorting
and plunging steers crowded away from the dazzling
beam of light, brighter and more intense
than the moon’s rays, and so divided and passed
on either side of the tourists’ encampment.
</p>
<p>
The odor of the beasts and the dust they kicked
up almost suffocated the girls, but they were unharmed.
Nor did the ponies and burros escape
with the frightened herd.
</p>
<p>
The racing punchers passed on either side of
the camp, shouting their congratulations to the
campers. The latter, however, enjoyed little further
sleep that night.
</p>
<p>
“Such excitement!” murmured Miss Cullam,
wrapped in her blanket and sitting before the
fire that Pedro had built up again. “And I
thought you said, Ruth Fielding, that this trip
would probably be no more strenuous than a picnic
on Bliss Island?”
</p>
<p>
But Min eyed the girl of the Red Mill with
something like admiration. “Huh!” she muttered,
“some of these Eastern tenderfoots are
some good in a pinch after all.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—AT HANDY GULCH</h2>
<p>
Sitting around a blanket spread for a tablecloth
at sunrise and eating eggs and bacon with
more flapjacks, the incidents of the night seemed
less tangible, and certainly less perilous.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I can’t imagine those mild-eyed cows
making such a scramble by us as they did,” Trix
Davenport remarked.
</p>
<p>
“‘Mild-eyed kine’ is good—very good indeed,”
said Jennie Stone. “These long-horns are about
as mild-tempered as wolves. I can remember that
we saw some of them in tempestuous mood up
at Silver Ranch. Isn’t that so, Helen?”
</p>
<p>
“Truly,” admitted the black-eyed girl.
</p>
<p>
“I shall never care even to <em>eat</em> beef if we go
through many such experiences as that stampede,”
Miss Cullam declared. “Let us hurry away from
the vicinity of these maddened beasts.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be off the range to-day,” said Min dryly.
“Then there won’t be nothing to scare you tenderfoots.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“No bears, or wolves, or panthers?” drawled
Jennie wickedly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy! You don’t mean there are such
creatures in the hills?” cried Rebecca.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t reckon we’ll meet up with such,” Min
said.
</p>
<p>
“Shouldn’t we have brought guns with us?”
asked Sally timidly.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! And shoot each other?” cried
Miss Cullam.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you didn’t say nothin’ about huntin’,”
said the guide slowly. “Pop’s got his rifle with
him. But I’m packin’ a forty-five; that’ll scare
off most anything on four laigs. And there ain’t
no two-legged critters to hurt us.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve an automatic,” said Tom Cameron quietly.
“Didn’t know but I might have a chance to
shoot a jackrabbit or the like.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” drawled Min, sarcastically. “We
ain’t likely to stay in one place long enough to
cook such a critter. They’re usually tougher’n all
git-out, Mister.”
</p>
<p>
“At any rate,” said Ruth, with satisfaction,
“the party is sufficiently armed. Let us not fear
bears or mountain lions.”
</p>
<p>
“Or jackrabbits,” chuckled Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“And are you <em>sure</em> there are no ill-disposed men
in the mountains?” asked the teacher.
</p>
<p>
“Men?” sniffed Min. “I ain’t ‘fraid of men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
I hope! There ain’t nothin’ wuss than a drunken
man, and I’ve had experience enough with them.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew she referred to her father; but she
did not tell the other girls and Miss Cullam what
Min had confided to her the previous evening.
</p>
<p>
The trail led them into the foothills that day
and before night the rugged nature of the ground
assured even Miss Cullam that there was little
likelihood of such an unpleasant happening as had
startled them the night before.
</p>
<p>
They halted to camp for the night beside a
collection of small huts and tents that marked the
presence of a placer digging which had been found
the spring before and still showed “color.”
</p>
<p>
There were nearly a dozen flannel-shirted and
high-booted miners at this spot, and the sight of
the girls from the East had a really startling effect
upon these lonely men. There was not a
woman at the camp.
</p>
<p>
The men knocked off work for the day the
moment the tourists arrived. Every man of them,
including the Mexican water-carrier, was broadly
asmile. And they were all ready and willing to
show “the ladies from the East” how placer mining
was done.
</p>
<p>
The output of a mountain spring had been
brought down an open plank sluice into the little
glen where the vein of fine gold had been discovered;
and with the current of this stream the gold-bearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
soil was “washed” in sluice-boxes.
</p>
<p>
The miners, rough but good-natured fellows,
all made a “clean up” then and there, and each
of the visitors was presented with a pinch of gold
dust, right from the riffles.
</p>
<p>
This placer mining camp was run on a community
basis, and the camp cook insisted upon getting
supper for all, and an abundant if not a delicately
prepared meal was the result.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure that we should allow these men
to go to so much expense and trouble,” Miss Cullam
whispered to Ruth and Min Peters.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, gee!” ejaculated the girl in boy’s clothing.
“Don’t let it worry you for a minute, Miss
Cullam. We’re a godsend to them fellers. If
they didn’t spend their money once’t in a while
they’d git too wealthy,” and she chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“That could not possibly be, when they work
so long and hard for a pinch of gold dust,” declared
the college instructor.
</p>
<p>
“They fling it away just as though it come
easy,” returned Min. “Believe me! it’s much
better for ’em to have you folks here and blow
you to their best, than it is for them to go down
to Yucca and blow it all in on red liquor.”
</p>
<p>
The miners would have gone further and given
up their cabins or their tents to the use of the
women. But even Rebecca had enjoyed sleeping
out the night before and would not be tempted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
The air was so dry and tonic in its qualities that
the walls of a house or even of a tent seemed superfluous.
</p>
<p>
“I do miss my morning plunge or shower,”
Helen admitted. “I feel as though all this red
dust and grit had got into my skin and never
would get out again. But one can’t rough it
and keep clean, too, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“That water in the sluice looks lovely,” confessed
Jennie Stone. “I’d dearly like to go paddling
in it if there weren’t so many men about.”
</p>
<p>
“After all,” said Ruth, “although we are traveling
like men we don’t act as they would. Tom
slipped off by himself and behind that screen of
bushes up there on the hillside he took a bath
in the sluice. But there isn’t a girl here who
would do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, lawsy, I didn’t bring my bathing suit,”
drawled Jennie. “That was an oversight.”
</p>
<p>
“Old Tom does get a few things on us, doesn’t
he?” commented Helen. “Perhaps being a boy
isn’t, after all, an unmitigated evil.”
</p>
<p>
“But the water’s so co-o-ld!” shivered Trix.
“I’m sure I wouldn’t care for a plunge in this
mountain stream. Will there be heated bathrooms
at Freezeout Camp, Fielding?”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” Miss Cullam ejaculated. “The title
of the place sounds as though steam heat would
be the fashion and tiled bathrooms plentiful!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
The third day of the journey was quite as fair
as the previous days; but the way was still more
rugged, so they did not travel so far. They
camped that night in a deep gorge, and it was
cold enough for the fires to feel grateful. Tom
and the Mexican kept two fires well supplied with
fuel all night. Once a coyote stood on a bank
above their heads and sang his song of hunger
and loneliness until, as Sally declared, she thought
she should “fly off the handle.”
</p>
<p>
“I never <em>did</em> hear such an unpleasant sound in
all my life—it beats the grinding of an ungreased
wagon wheel! I wish you would drive him away,
Tom.”
</p>
<p>
So Tom pulled out the automatic that he had
been “aching” to use, and sent a couple of shots
in the direction of the lank and hungry beast—who
immediately crossed the gorge and serenaded
them from the other bank!
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use of killing a perfectly useless
creature?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“No fear,” laughed Jennie. “Tom won’t kill
it. He’s only shooting holes in the circumambient
atmosphere.”
</p>
<p>
There was a haze over the mountain tops at
dawn on the fourth day; but Min assured the girls
that it could not mean rain. “We ain’t had no
rain for so long that it’s forgotten how,” she said.
“But mebbe there’ll be a wind storm before night.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! as long as we’re dry——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss Ruth,” put in the girl guide. “We’ll
be <em>dry</em>, all right. But a wind storm here in Arizona
ain’t to be sneezed at. Sometimes it comes
right cold, too.”
</p>
<p>
“In summer?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep. It can git mighty cold in summer if it
sets out to. But we’ll try to make Handy Gulch
early and git under cover if the sand begins to
sift.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh me! oh my!” groaned Jennie. “A sand
storm? And like Helen I feel already as though
the dust was gritted into the pores of my skin.”
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t onhealthy,” Min returned dryly.
“Some o’ these old-timers live a year without seein’
enough water to take a bath in. The sand gives
’em a sort of dry wash. It’s clean dirt.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing like getting used to a point of view,”
whispered Sally Blanchard. “Fancy! A ‘dry
wash!’ How do <em>you</em> feel, Rebecca Frayne?”
</p>
<p>
“Just as gritty as you do,” was the prompt reply.
</p>
<p>
“All right then,” laughed Ruth. “We all must
have grit enough to hurry along and reach this
Handy Gulch before the storm bursts.”
</p>
<p>
Min told them that there was a “sure enough”
hotel at the settlement they were approaching. It
was a camp where hydraulic mining was being
conducted on a large scale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“The claims belong mostly to the Arepo Mining
and Smelting Company. They have several mines
through the Hualapai Range,” said the guide.
“This Handy place is quite a town. Only trouble
is, there’s two rum sellin’ places. Most of the
men’s wages go back to the company through
drink and cards, for they control the shops. But
some day Arizona is goin’ dry, and then we’ll shut
up all such joints.”
</p>
<p>
“Dry!” coughed Helen. “Could anything be
dryer than Arizona is right here and now?”
</p>
<p>
The seemingly tireless ponies carried the girls
at a lope, or a gallop, all that forenoon. It was
hard to get the eager little beasts to walk, and
they never trotted. Miss Cullam claimed that
everything inside of her had “come loose and was
rattling around like dice in a box.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, girls,” sighed the teacher, “if this
jumping and jouncing is really a healthful exercise,
I shall surely taste death through an accident.
But good health is something horrid to
attain—in this way.”
</p>
<p>
But in spite of the discomforts of the mode
of travel, the party hugely enjoyed the outing.
There were so many new and strange things to see,
and one always came back to the same statement:
“The air <em>is</em> lovely!”
</p>
<p>
There were certainly new things to see when
they arrived at Handy Gulch just after lunch time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
not having stopped for that meal by the way. The
camp consisted of fully a hundred wood and sheet-iron
shacks, and the hotel was of two stories and
was quite an important looking building.
</p>
<p>
Above the town, which squatted in a narrow
valley through which a brawling and muddy
stream flowed, was the “bench” from which the
gold was being mined. There were four “guns”
in use and these washed down the raw hillside into
open sluices, the riffles of which caught the separated
gold. The girls were shown a nugget found
that very morning. It was as big as a walnut.
</p>
<p>
But most of the precious metal was found in
tiny nuggets, or in dust, a grain of which seemed
no larger than the head of a common pin.
</p>
<p>
However, although these things were interesting,
the minute the cavalcade rode up to the hotel
something much more interesting happened.
There was a cry of welcome from within and out
of the front door charged Jane Ann Hicks,
dressed much as she used to be on the ranch—broad
sombrero, a short fringed skirt over her
riding breeches, high boots with spurs, and a gun
slung at her belt.
</p>
<p>
“For the good land of love!” she demanded,
seizing Ruth Fielding as the latter tumbled off her
horse. “Where have you girls been? I was just
about riding back to that Yucca place to look for
you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
Jennie and Helen came in for a warm welcome,
too. Ann was presented to Miss Cullam and the
other two girls before explanations were made
by anybody. Then Ruth demanded of the Montana
girl a full and particular account of what
she had done, and why.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I reckon that Miss Phelps ain’t a friend
of yours, after all?” queried Ann. “She’s one
frost, if she is.”
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve said something, Nita,” said Jennie
Stone. “She is a cold proposition. Can you
tell us what she’s doing out here?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. She sure enough comes from
that college you girls attend, don’t she?”
</p>
<p>
“She does!” admitted Helen. “She truly does.
But she’s not a sample of what Ardmore puts forth—don’t
believe it.”
</p>
<p>
“I opine she’s not a sample of any product, except
orneriness,” scolded Ann, who was a good
deal put out by the strange actions of Edith
Phelps. “You see how it was. My train was
late. According to the telegram I found waiting
for me, you folks should have arrived at Yucca
hours ahead of me.”
</p>
<p>
“And we were delayed,” sighed Ruth. “Go
on.”
</p>
<p>
“I saw this Phelps girl,” pursued Ann Hicks,
“and asked her about you folks. She said you’d
been and gone.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” was the chorused exclamation from the
other girls.
</p>
<p>
“And <em>she</em> is one of my pupils!” groaned Miss
Cullam.
</p>
<p>
“She didn’t learn to tell whoppers at your college,
I guess,” said Ann, bluntly. “Anyhow, she
fooled me nicely. She said she was going over this
very route you had taken and I could come along.
She wouldn’t let me pay any of the expenses—not
even tip the guide. Only for my pony.”
</p>
<p>
“But where is she now?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“And where is that Flapjack person—Min’s
father?” cried Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“We got here last night and put up at this
hotel,” Ann said, going steadily on with her story
and not to be drawn away on any side issues. “We
got here last night. Late in the evening somebody
came to see this Phelps girl—a man.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” exclaimed Rebecca. “And she is
traveling without a chaperon!”
</p>
<p>
“‘Chaperon’—huh!” ejaculated Ann. “She
didn’t need any chaperon. She can take care of
herself all right. Well, she didn’t come back and
I went to bed. This morning I found a bit of
paper on my pillow—here ’tis——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Edie’s handwriting,” Sally Blanchard
said eagerly. “What does it say?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Good-bye. I am not going any farther with
you. Wait, and your friends may overtake you.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
Just that,” said Ann, with disgust. “Can you beat
it?”
</p>
<p>
“What has that wild girl done, do you suppose?”
murmured Miss Cullam.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she isn’t wild—not so’s you’d notice it,”
said Ann. “Believe me, she knows her way about.
And she shipped that guide.”
</p>
<p>
“Discharged Mr. Peters, do you mean?” Ruth
asked. Min was not in the room while this conversation
was going on.
</p>
<p>
“H’m. Yes. <em>Mister</em> Peters. He’s some sour
dough, I should say! He was paid off and set
down with money in his fist between two saloons.
They’re across the street from each other, and
they tell me he’s been swinging from one bar to
the other like a pendulum ever since he was paid
off.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor Min!” sighed Ruth Fielding.
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” said Ann Hicks. “If he’s got any
folks, <em>I’m</em> sorry for ’em, too.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—MIN SHOWS HER METTLE</h2>
<p>
There were means to be obtained at the Handy
Gulch Hotel for the baths that the tourists so
much desired, even if tiled bathrooms and hot
and cold water faucets were not in evidence.
</p>
<p>
The party lunched after making fresh toilets,
and then set forth to view the “sights.” Ruth inquired
of Tom for Min; but their guide had disappeared
the moment the party reached the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“She’s acquainted here, I presume,” said Tom
Cameron. “Maybe she doesn’t wish to be seen
with you girls. Her outfit is so very different from
yours.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor Min!” murmured Ruth again. “Do you
suppose she has found her father?”
</p>
<p>
Tom could not tell her that, and they trailed
along behind the others, up toward the bench
where the hydraulic mining was going on.
</p>
<p>
Only one of the nozzles was being worked—shooting
a solid stream three inches in diameter
into the hillside, and shaving off great slices that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
melted and ran in a creamlike paste down into
the sluice-boxes. Half a hundred “muckers” were
at work with pick and shovel below the bench.
The man managing the hydraulic machine stood
astride of it, in hip boots and slicker, and guided
the spouting stream of water along the face of the
raw hill.
</p>
<p>
The party of spectators stood well out of the
way, for the work of hydraulic mining has attached
to it no little danger. The force of the
stream from the nozzle of the machine is tremendous;
and sometimes there are accidents, when
many tons of the hillside unexpectedly cave down
upon the bench.
</p>
<p>
The man astride the nozzle, however, took the
matter coolly enough. He was smoking a short
pipe and plowed along the face of the rubble with
his deadly stream as easily as though he were
watering a lawn.
</p>
<p>
“And if he should shoot it this way,” said Tom,
“he’d wash us down off the bench as though we
were pebbles.”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh! Let’s not talk about that,” murmured
Rebecca Frayne, shivering.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girls!” burst out Helen, “see that man,
will you?”
</p>
<p>
“What man?” asked Trix.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Where</em> man?” demanded Jennie Stone.
</p>
<p>
“Running this way. Why! what can have happened?” Helen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
pursued. “Look, Tom, has there
been an accident?”
</p>
<p>
A hatless man came running from the far end
of the bench. He was swinging his arms and his
mouth was wide open, though they could not hear
what he was shouting. The noise of the spurting
water and falling rubble drowned most other
sounds.
</p>
<p>
“Why, girls,” shouted Ann Hicks, and her voice
rose above the noise of the hydraulic, “that’s the
feller that guided us up here. That’s Peters!”
</p>
<p>
“Flapjack Peters?” repeated Tom. “The man
acts as if he were crazy!”
</p>
<p>
The bewhiskered and roughly dressed man gave
evidence of exactly the misfortune Tom mentioned.
His eyes blazed, his manner was distraught,
and he came on along the bench in great
leaps, shouting unintelligibly.
</p>
<p>
“He is intoxicated. Let us go away,” Miss Cullam
said promptly.
</p>
<p>
But the excitement of the moment held the
girls spellbound, and Miss Cullam herself merely
stepped back a pace. A crowd of men were chasing
the irrepressible Peters. Their shouts warned
the fellow at the nozzle of the hydraulic machine.
</p>
<p>
He turned to look over his shoulder, the stream
of water still plowing down the wall of gravel and
soil. It bored directly into the hillside and down
fell a huge lump, four or five tons of debris.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“Git back out o’ here, ye crazy loon!” yelled
the man, shifting the nozzle and bringing down
another pile of rubble.
</p>
<p>
But Peters plunged on and in a moment had the
other by the shoulders. With insane strength he
tore the miner away from the machine and flung
him a dozen feet. The stream of water shifted
to the right as the hydraulic machine slewed
around.
</p>
<p>
“Come away! Come away from that, Pop!”
shrieked a voice, and the amazed Eastern girls
saw Min Peters darting along the bench toward
the scene.
</p>
<p>
Peters sprang astride the nozzle and shifted it
quickly back and forth so that the water spread
in all directions. He knew how to handle the
machine; the peril lay in what he might decide to
do with it.
</p>
<p>
“Come away from that, Pop!” shrieked Min
again.
</p>
<p>
But her father flirted the stream around, threatening
the girl and those who followed her. The
men stopped. They knew what would happen if
that solid stream of water collided with a human
body!
</p>
<p>
“D’you hear me, Pop?” again cried the fearless
girl. “You git off that pipe and let Bob have it.”
</p>
<p>
Bob, the pipeman, was just getting to his feet—wrathful
and muddy. But he did not attempt to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
charge Peters. The latter again swept the stream
along the hillside in a wide arc, bringing tons upon
tons of gravel and soil down upon the bench. The
narrow plateau was becoming choked with it.
There was danger of his burying the hydraulic
machine, as well as himself, in an avalanche.
</p>
<p>
The tourist party was in peril, too. They
scarcely understood this at the moment, for things
were transpiring so quickly that only seconds had
elapsed since first Peters had approached.
</p>
<p>
The miners dared not come closer. But Min
showed no fear. She plunged in and caught him
around the body, trying to confine his arms so
that he could not slew the nozzle to either side.
</p>
<p>
This helped the situation but little. For half
a minute the stream shot straight into the hillside;
then another great lump fell.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment Peters threw her off, and
Min went rolling over and over in the mud as
Bob had gone. But she was up again in a moment
and made another spring for the man.
</p>
<p>
And then suddenly, quite as unexpectedly as the
riot had started, it was all over. The hurtling,
hissing stream of water fell to a wabbling, futile
out-pouring; then to a feeble dribble from the
pipe’s nozzle. The water had been shut off below.
</p>
<p>
The miners pyramided upon him, and in half
a minute Flapjack Peters was “spread-eagled” on
the muddy bench, held by a dozen brawny arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait! wait!” cried Ruth, running forward.
“Don’t hurt him. Take care——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t hurt him, Miss?” growled Bob, the
man who had been flung aside. “We ought to nigh
about knock the daylights out o’ him. Look what
he done to me.”
</p>
<p>
“But you mustn’t! He’s not responsible,” Ruth
Fielding urged.
</p>
<p>
The miners dragged Peters to his feet and there
was blood on his face. Here is where Min showed
the mettle that was in her again. She sprang in
among the angry miners to her father’s side.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t none of you forgit he’s my pop,” she
threatened in a tone that held the girls who listened
spellbound and amazed.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t got no call to beat him up. You
know he can’t stand red liquor; yet some of you
helped him drink of it las’ night. Ain’t that the
truth?”
</p>
<p>
Bob was the first to admit her statement. “I
s’pose you’re right, Min. We done drunk with
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! You helped him waste his money.
Then, when he goes loco like he always does,
you’re for beatin’ of him up. My lawsy! if there’s
anything on top o’ this here airth more ornery than
that I ain’t never seen it.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—AN URSINE HOLDUP</h2>
<p>
Peters was still struggling with his captors and
talking wildly. He evidently did not know his
own daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what you goin’ to do with him?” demanded
Bob, the pipeman. “We ain’t expected
to stand and hold him all day, if we ain’t goin’ to
be ’lowed to hang him—the ornery critter!”
</p>
<p>
“You shet up, Bob Davis!” said Min. “You
ain’t no pulin’ infant yourself when you’re drunk,
and you know it.”
</p>
<p>
The other men began laughing at the angry
miner, and Bob admitted:
</p>
<p>
“Well, s’posin’ that’s so? I’m sober now. And
I got work to do. So’s these other fellows. What
you want done with Flapjack?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was so deeply interested for
Min’s sake that she could not help interfering.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Min, isn’t there a doctor in this camp?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m. Doc Quibbly. He’s here, ain’t he,
boys?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“The old doc’s down to his office in the tin
shack beyant the hotel,” said one. “I seen him
not an hour ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s take your father to the hotel, Min,”
Ruth said. “These men will help us, I know. So
will Tom Cameron. We will have the doctor look
after your father.”
</p>
<p>
“The old doc can dope him a-plenty, I reckon,”
said Bob.
</p>
<p>
“Sure we’ll help you,” said the rough fellows,
who were not really hard-hearted after all.
</p>
<p>
“I dunno’s they’ll let him into the hotel,” Min
said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes they will. We’ll pay for his room and you
and the doctor can look out for him,” Ruth declared.
</p>
<p>
“You are good and helpful, Ruth Fielding,”
said Miss Cullam, coming forward, much as she
despised the condition of the man, Peters. “How
terrible! But one must be sorry for that poor
girl.”
</p>
<p>
“And Min has pluck all right!” cried Jennie
Stone, admiringly. “We must help her.”
</p>
<p>
They were all agreed in this. Even Rebecca
and Miss Cullam, who both shrank from the
coarseness of the men and the roughness of Min
and her father, commiserated the man’s misfortune
and were sorry for Min’s strait.
</p>
<p>
Tom assisted in leading the wildly-talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Peters to the hotel. Ruth and Miss Cullam hurried
on in advance to engage a room for the man
whom they assured the proprietor was really ill.
Min, meanwhile, went in search of the camp’s
medical practitioner.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Quibbly was a gray-bearded man with keen
eyes but palsied hands. He had plainly been
wrecked by misfortune or some disease; but he
had been left with all his mental powers unimpaired.
</p>
<p>
He took hold of the distraught Peters in a
capable manner; and Tom, who remained to help
nurse the patient, declared to Ruth and Helen
that he never hoped to see a doctor who knew his
business better than Dr. Quibbly knew it.
</p>
<p>
“He had Peters quiet in half an hour. No
harmful drug, either. Told me everything he
used. Says rest, and milk and eggs to build up
the stomach, is all the chap needs. Min’s with
him now and I’m going to sleep in my blanket outside
the door to-night, so if she needs anybody
I’ll be within call.”
</p>
<p>
It had been rather an exciting experience for
the girls and they remained in their rooms for the
rest of the day. The hotel proprietor offered to
take them around at night and “show them the
sights”; but as that meant visiting the two saloons
and gambling halls, Miss Cullam refused for the
party, rather tartly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“No offence meant, Ma’am,” said the hotel
man, Mr. Bennett. “But most of the tenderfeet
that come here hanker to ‘go slumming,’ as they
call it. They want to see these here miners at
their amusements, as well as at their daily occupations.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather see them at church,” Miss Cullam
told him frankly. “I think they need it.”
</p>
<p>
“Good glory, Ma’am!” exclaimed the man.
“We git that, too—once a month. What more kin
you expect?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” Miss Cullam said to her girls,
“that a perfectly straight-laced New England
old maid could not be set down in a more inappropriate
place than a mining camp.”
</p>
<p>
The speech gave Ruth a suggestion for a scene
in the picture play of “The Forty-Niners,” and
she would have been delighted to have the Ardmore
teacher play a part in that scene.
</p>
<p>
“However,” she said to Helen, whispering it
over in bed that night, “it will be funny. I know
Mr. Hammond will bring plenty of costumes of
the period of forty-nine, for he wants women in
the show. And there will be some character actress
who can take the part of an unsophisticated
blue stocking from the Hub, who arrives at the
camp in the midst of the miner’s revelry.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped Helen. “Miss Cullam will
think you are making fun of her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“No she won’t——the dear thing! She has
too much good sense. But she <em>has</em> given me what
Tom would call a dandy idea.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it nice to have Tom—or somebody—to
lay our use of slang to?” said Ruth’s chum demurely.
</p>
<p>
The party did not leave Handy Gulch the next
day, nor the day following. There were several
excuses given for this delay and they were all
good.
</p>
<p>
One of the ponies had developed lameness; and
a burro wandered away and Pedro had to spend
half a day searching for him. Perhaps the Mexican
lad would have been quicker about this had
Min been on hand to hurry him. But having been
close beside her father all night she lay down for
needed sleep while Tom Cameron and the doctor
took her place.
</p>
<p>
The report from the sickroom was favorable.
In a few hours the man who had come so near to
bringing about a tragedy in Handy Gulch would
be fit to travel. Ruth declared that she would
wait for him, and he should go along with the
party to Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
“But you are our guide and general factotum,
Min. We depend on you,” she told the sick man’s
daughter.
</p>
<p>
“I dunno what that thing is you called me; but
I guess it ain’t a bad name,” said Min Peters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
“If you’ll jest let pop trail along so’s I kin watch
him he’ll be as good as pie, I know.”
</p>
<p>
Then, there was Miss Cullam’s reason for not
wishing to start. She said she was “saddle sick.”
</p>
<p>
“I have been seasick, and trainsick; but I think
saddlesick must be the worst, for it lasts longer.
I can lie in bed now,” said the poor woman, “and
feel myself wabbling just as I do in that hateful
saddle.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me, Ruthie Fielding! I wish I had
never agreed to come without demanding a comfortable
carriage.”
</p>
<p>
“They tell me that there are places on the trail
before we get to Freezeout so narrow that a carriage
can’t be used. The wagons are going miles
and miles around so as to escape the rough places
of the straighter trail.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” exclaimed Miss Cullam in disgust.
“Is it necessary to get to Freezeout Camp
in such a short time? I tell you right now: I am
going to rest in bed for two days.”
</p>
<p>
And she did. The girls were not worried, however.
They found plenty to see and to do about
the mining town. As for Ruth, she set to work on
her scenario, and kept Rebecca Frayne busy with
the typewriter, too. She sketched out the scene
she had mentioned to Helen, and it was so funny
that Rebecca giggled all the time she was typewriting
it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” murmured Ruth. “I hope the
audiences will think it is as funny as you do. The
only trouble is, unless a good deal of the conversation
is thrown on the screen, they will miss
some of the best points. Dear me! Such is fate.
I was born to be a humorist—a real humorist—in
a day and age when ‘custard-pie comedians’
have the right-of-way.”
</p>
<p>
The third day the party started bright and early
on the Freezeout trail. Flapjack Peters was well
enough to ride; and he was woefully sorry for
what he had done. But he was still too much
“twisted” in his mind to be able to tell Ruth just
how he came to start away from Yucca with Edith
Phelps and Ann Hicks, instead of waiting for the
entire party to arrive.
</p>
<p>
Ann had told all she knew about it at her meeting
with Ruth. It remained a mystery why Edith
had come to Yucca; why she had kept Ann and
her friends apart; and why at Handy Gulch she
had abandoned both Ann and Flapjack Peters.
</p>
<p>
“She met a man here, that’s all I know,” said
Ann, with disgust.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it was the man who wrote her from
Yucca,” said Helen to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“‘Box twenty-four, R. F. D., Yucca, Arizona,’”
murmured Ruth. “We should have made
inquiries in Yucca about the person who has his
mail come to that postbox.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“These hindsights that should have been foresights
are the limit!” groaned Helen. “We must
admit that Edie Phelps has put one over on us.
But what it is she has done <em>I</em> do not comprehend.”
</p>
<p>
“That is what bothers me,” Ruth said, shaking
her head.
</p>
<p>
They set off on this day from the Gulch in a
spirit of cheerfulness, and ready for any adventure.
However, none of the party—not a soul of
it—really expected what did happen before the
end of the day.
</p>
<p>
As usual the pony cavalcade got ahead of the
burros in the forenoon. The little animals would
go only so fast no matter what was done to them.
</p>
<p>
“You could put a stick of dynamite under one
o’ them critters,” Min said, “and he’d rise slow-like.
‘Hurry up’ ain’t knowed to the burros’ language—believe
me!”
</p>
<p>
The pony cavalcade was halted most surprisingly
about noon, and in a way which bid fair to
delay the party until the burros caught up, if not
longer. They had got well into the hills. The
cliffs rose on either hand to towering heights.
Thick and scrubby woods masked the sides of the
gorge through which they rode.
</p>
<p>
“It is as wild as one could imagine,” said Miss
Cullam, riding with Tom in the lead. “What do
you suppose is the matter with my pony, Mr. Cameron?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
Tom had begun to be puzzled about his own
mount—a wise old, flea-bitten gray. The ponies
had pricked their ears forward and were snuffing
the air as though there was some unpleasant odor
assailing their nostrils.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know just what is the matter,” Tom
confessed. “But these creatures can see and smell
a lot that <em>we</em> can’t, Miss Cullam. Perhaps we
had better halt and——”
</p>
<p>
He got no further. They were just rounding
an elbow in the trail. There before them, rising
up on their haunches in the path, were three gray
and black bears!
</p>
<p>
“Ow-yow!” shrieked Jennie Stone. “Do you
girls see the same things <em>I</em> do?”
</p>
<p>
To those ahead, however, it seemed no matter
for laughter. The bears—evidently a female with
two cubs—were too close for fun-making.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—AT FREEZEOUT CAMP</h2>
<p>
There is nothing really savage looking about
a bear unless it <em>is</em> savage. Otherwise a bear has a
rather silly looking countenance. These three
bears had been walking peacefully down the trail,
and were surprised at the sudden appearance of
the cavalcade of ponies from around the bend, for
such wind as was stirring was blowing down the
trail.
</p>
<p>
The larger bear, the mother of the two half-grown
cubs, instantly realized the danger of their
position. It may have looked like an ursine
hold-up to the tourists; but old Mother Bear was
quite sure she and her cubs were in man-peril.
</p>
<p>
She growled fiercely, cuffing her cubs right and
left and sending them scuttling and whining off
into the bushes. She roared at the startled pony
riders and did not descend from her haunches.
</p>
<p>
She looked terrible enough then. Her teeth,
fully displayed, promised to tear and rend both
ponies and riders if they came near enough.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Cullam was speechless with fright. The
ponies had halted, snorting; but for the first minute
or so none of them backed away from the
threatening beast.
</p>
<p>
The hair rose stiffly on the bear’s neck and she
uttered a second challenging growl. Tom had
pulled out his automatic; but he had already
learned that at any considerable distance
this weapon was not to be depended upon. Min’s
forty-five threw a bullet where one aimed; not so
the newfangled weapon.
</p>
<p>
Besides, the bear was a big one and it really
looked as though a pistol ball would be an awfully
silly thing to throw at it.
</p>
<p>
Rebecca Frayne had just begun to cry and Sally
Blanchard was begging everybody to “come
away,” when Min Peters slipped around from the
rear to the head of the column.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on to your horses, girls,” she whispered
shrilly. “Mebbe some of ’em’s gun-shy. Steady
now—and we’ll have bear’s tongue and liver for
supper.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Minnie!” squealed Helen.
</p>
<p>
Min was not to be disturbed from her purpose
by any hysterical girl. She was not depending
upon her forty-five for the work in hand. She had
brought her father’s rifle from Handy Gulch;
and now it came in use most opportunely.
</p>
<p>
The bear was still on its haunches and still roaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
when Min got into position. The beast was
an easy mark, and the Western girl dropped on
one knee, thus steadying her aim, for the rifle was
heavy.
</p>
<p>
The bear roared again; then the rifle roared.
The latter almost knocked Min over, the recoil
was so great. But the shot quite knocked the
bear over. The heavy slug of lead had penetrated
the beast’s heart and lungs.
</p>
<p>
She staggered forward, the blood spouted from
her wide open jaws as well as from her breast;
and finally she came down with a crash upon the
hard trail. She was quite dead before she hit the
ground.
</p>
<p>
There was screaming enough then. Everybody
save Ann Hicks and Tom, perhaps, had quite lost
his self-control. Such a jabbering as followed!
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me, girls,” drawled Jennie Stone at
last, raising her voice so as to be heard. “Goodness
me! Min just wasted that perfectly good
lead bullet. We could easily have talked that
poor bear to death.”
</p>
<p>
It had been rather a startling incident, however,
and they were not likely to stop talking about
it immediately. Miss Cullam was more than
frightened by the event; she felt that she had been
misled.
</p>
<p>
“I had no idea there were actually wild creatures
like those bears in this country, Ruth Fielding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
I certainly never would have come had I
realized it. You could not have hired me to come
on this trip.”
</p>
<p>
“But, dear Miss Cullam,” Ruth said, somewhat
troubled because the lady was, “I really had no
idea they were here.”
</p>
<p>
“I assure you,” Helen said soberly, “that the
bears did not appear by <em>my</em> invitation, much as I
enjoy mild excitement.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Mild excitement’!” breathed Rebecca
Frayne. “My word!”
</p>
<p>
“And those other two bears are loose and may
attack us,” pursued Miss Cullam.
</p>
<p>
“They were only cubs, Miss,” said Min, who,
with her father, was already at work removing the
bear’s pelt. “They’re running yet. And I shouldn’t
have shot this critter only it might have done some
damage, being mad because of its young. We may
have to explain this shootin’ to the game wardens.
There’s a closed season for bears like there is for
game birds. There ain’t many left.”
</p>
<p>
“And do they really want to keep any of the
horrid creatures <em>alive?</em>” demanded Trix Davenport.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Bear shootin’ attracts tenderfoots; and
tenderfoots have money to spend. That’s the
how of it,” explained Min.
</p>
<p>
The ponies did not like the smell of the bear,
and they were all drawn ahead on the trail. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
the cavalcade waited for Pedro and the burros to
overtake them; then the load on one burro was
transferred to the ponies and the pelt and as much
of the bear meat as they could make use of in such
warm weather was put upon the burro.
</p>
<p>
“Not that either the skin or the meat’s much
good this time o’ year. She ain’t got fatted up
yet after sucklin’ them cubs. But, anyway, you
kin say ye had bear meat when you git back East,”
Min declared practically.
</p>
<p>
The girls went on after that with their eyes
very wide open. Miss Cullam declared that she
knew she never would forget how those three
bears looked standing on their hind legs and “glaring”
at her.
</p>
<p>
“Glaring!” repeated Jennie Stone. “All I could
see was that old bear’s open mouth. It quite
swallowed up her eyes.”
</p>
<p>
“What an acrobatic feat!” sighed Trix Davenport.
“You <em>do</em> have an imagination, Jennie
Stone.”
</p>
<p>
The event did not pass over as a matter for
laughter altogether; the girls had really been given
a severe fright. Min was obliged to ride ahead,
or the tourists never would have rounded a bend
in the trail in real comfort. It was probable that
the Western girl had a hearty contempt for their
cowardice. “But what could you expect of tenderfoots?”
she grumbled to Ann Hicks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“D’you know,” said the girl from Silver Ranch
to the girl guide, “that is what I used to think
about these Eastern girlies—that they were only
babies. But just because they are gun-shy, and are
unused to many of the phases of outdoor life with
which you and I are familiar, Min, doesn’t make
them altogether useless.
</p>
<p>
“Believe me, my dear! when it comes to book
learning, and knowing how to dress, and being
used to the society game, these girls from Ardmore
are <em>sharks!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon that’s right,” agreed Min. “I
watched ’em come off the train in Yucca, and they
looked like they’d just stepped out of a mail-order
house catalogue. Such fixin’s!” and the girl who
had never worn proper feminine clothing sighed
longingly at the remembrance of the Ardmore
girls’ traveling dresses and hats.
</p>
<p>
The more Min saw of the Eastern girls, the
more desirous she was of being like them—in some
ways, at least. She might sneer at their lack of
physical courage; nevertheless, she was well aware
that they were used to many things of which she
knew very little. And there never was a girl born
who did not long for pretty clothes, and who did
not wish to appear attractive in the eyes of others.
</p>
<p>
Helen and Jennie had not forgotten their idea
of dressing their guide in some of their furbelows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“Just wait till our trunks get to that Freezeout
place, along with your movie people, Ruth,” said
Jennie. “We’ll just doll poor Min all up.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s an idea!” exclaimed the girl of the Red
Mill, her mind quick to absorb any suggestion relative
to her art. “I can put Min in the picture—if
she will agree. Show her as she is, then have her
metamorphosised into a pretty girl—for she <em>is</em>
pretty.”
</p>
<p>
“From the ugly caterpillar to the butterfly,”
cried Helen.
</p>
<p>
“A regular Bret Harte character—queen of the
mining camp,” said Jennie. “You can give me a
share of your royalties, Ruth, for this suggestion.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had so many ideas in her head for scenes
at the mining camp that she was anxious to get
over the trail and reach Freezeout. By this time
Mr. Hammond and his outfit must have arrived
at Yucca.
</p>
<p>
The trail was rough, however, and the cavalcade
of college girls could travel only about so
fast. Those unfamiliar with saddle work, like
Miss Cullam, found the journey hard enough.
</p>
<p>
At night they had to camp in the open, after
leaving Handy Gulch; and because of the appearance
of the bears, there were two guards set at
night, and the fires were kept up. Tom and Pedro
took half the watch, and then Min and her father
took their turn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
Nothing happened of moment, however, during
the three nights that ensued before the party
reached the abandoned camp of Freezeout. They
came down into the “draw” or arroyo in which the
old mining camp lay late one afternoon. A more
deserted-looking place could scarcely be imagined.
</p>
<p>
There were half a hundred log cabins, of assorted
sizes and in different stages of dilapidation.
The air was so dry and so little rain fell in
this part of Arizona that the log walls of the
structures were in fairly good condition, and not
all the roofs had fallen in.
</p>
<p>
Min and her father, with Tom Cameron,
searched among the cabins to find those most suitable
for occupancy. But it was Ruth Fielding who
discovered something that startled the whole
party.
</p>
<p>
“See here! See here!” she called. “I’ve found
something.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Tom. “More bears?”
</p>
<p>
“No. Somebody has been ahead of us here.
Perhaps we are not alone in having an interest in
this Freezeout place.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, Ruthie?” cried Helen, running
to her chum.
</p>
<p>
“Here are the remains of a campfire. The
ashes are still warm. Somebody camped here last
night, that is sure. Do you suppose they are here
now?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—MORE DISCOVERIES</h2>
<p>
A quick but thorough search of the abandoned
mining camp revealed no living person save the
party of tourists themselves.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s inquiry for the persons who had built
the campfire aroused the curiosity of Min Peters
and her father, and they made some investigations
for which the girl from the East scarcely saw the
reason.
</p>
<p>
“If we’ve got neighbors here, might’s well know
who they are,” said Flapjack, who was gradually
finding his voice and was “spunking up,” according
to his daughter’s statement.
</p>
<p>
Peters was particularly anxious to please. He
felt deeply the humiliation of what he had gone
through at Handy Gulch, and wished to show
Ruth and the other girls that he was of some account.
</p>
<p>
No Indian could have scrutinized the vicinity
of the dead campfire which Ruth had found more
carefully than he did. Finally he announced that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
two men had been here at the abandoned settlement
the night before.
</p>
<p>
“One big feller and a mighty little man. I don’t
know what to make of that little feller’s footprints,”
said the old prospector. “Mebbe he ain’t
only a boy. But they camped here—sure. And
they’ve gone on—right out through the dry watercourse
an’ toward the east. I reckon they was
harmless.”
</p>
<p>
“They surely will be harmless if they keep on
going and never come back,” laughed Ruth. “But
I hope there are not many idlers hanging about
this neighbourhood. I suppose there are some
bad characters in these hills?”
</p>
<p>
“About as bad as tramps are in town,” said
Min, scornfully. “You folks from the East do
have funny ideas. Ev’ry other man out here ain’t
a train robber nor a cattle rustler. No, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
“The movie company will supply all those, I
fancy,” chuckled Jennie Stone. “Going to have a
real, bad road agent in your play, Ruthie?”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind what I am going to have,” retorted
Ruth, shaking her head. “I mean to have
just as true a picture as possible of the old-time
gold diggings; and that doesn’t mean that guns are
flourished every minute or two. Mr. Peters can
help me a lot by telling me what he remembers of
this very camp, I know.”
</p>
<p>
Flapjack was greatly pleased at this. Although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
Ruth continued to keep Min, the girl guide, to the
fore, she saw that the girl’s father was going to be
vastly pleased by being made of some account.
</p>
<p>
It was he who advised which of the cabins
should be made habitable for the party. One was
selected for the girls and Miss Cullam to sleep in;
another for the men; and a third for a kitchen.
</p>
<p>
But Flapjack made supper that night in the open
as usual. For the first time he proudly displayed
to the girls from the East the talent by which his
nickname originated.
</p>
<p>
Min made a great “crock” of batter and
greased the griddles for him. Flapjack stood, red
faced and eager, over the bed of live coals and
handled the two griddles in an expert manner.
</p>
<p>
The cakes were as large as breakfast plates,
and were browned to a beautiful shade—one fried
in each griddle. When the time came to turn
them, Flapjack Peters performed this delicate
operation by tossing them into the air, and with
such a sleight of hand that the flapjacks exchanged
griddles in their “turnover”.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Cullam. “Such
acrobatic cooking I never beheld. But the cakes
are remarkably tasty.”
</p>
<p>
“Aeroplane pancakes,” suggested Tom Cameron.
“Believe me, they are as light as they fly,
too.”
</p>
<p>
That night the party was particularly jolly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
They had reached their destination and, as Miss
Cullam said in relief, without dire mishap.
</p>
<p>
The girls were, after all, glad to shut a door
against the whole outside world when they went to
bed; although the windows were merely holes in
the cabin walls through which the air had a perfectly
free circulation.
</p>
<p>
There were six bunks in the cabin; but only one
of them was put in proper condition for use. Miss
Cullam was given that and the girls rolled up in
their blankets on the floor, with their saddles, as
usual, for pillows.
</p>
<p>
“We have got so used to camping out of doors,”
Helen Cameron said, “that we shall be unable to
sleep in our beds when we get home.”
</p>
<p>
In the morning, however, the first work Min
started was to fill bags with dried grass from the
hillsides and make mattresses for all the bunks.
Tom had brought along hammer and nails as well
as a saw, and with the old prospector’s assistance
he repaired the remainder of the bunks in the girls’
cabin and put up three new ones. There was
plenty of building material about the camp.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, meantime, cleared out a fourth cabin.
Here was set up the typewriter, and she and Rebecca
Frayne planned to make the hut their workshop.
</p>
<p>
“You girls, as long as you don’t leave the confines
of the camp alone, are welcome to go where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
you please, only, save, and excepting to the sanctum
sanctorum,” Ruth said at lunch time. “I am
going to put up a sign over the door, ‘Beware.’”
</p>
<p>
“But surely, Ruth, you’re not going to work <em>all</em>
the time?” complained Helen.
</p>
<p>
“How are we going to have any fun, Ruth
Fielding, if you keep out of it?” demanded Ann
Hicks.
</p>
<p>
“I shall get up early and work in the forenoon.
While the mood is on me and my mind is fresh,
you know,” laughed Ruth. “That is, I shall do
that after I really get to work. First I must ‘soak
in’ local color.”
</p>
<p>
She did this by wandering alone through the
shallow gorge, from the first, or lower “diggings,”
up to the final abandoned claim, where the gold
pockets had petered out. There were hundreds
of places about the old camp where the gold hunters
had dug in hope of finding the precious metal.
</p>
<p>
Ruth really knew little about this work. But
she had learned from hearing Min and her father
talk that, wherever there was gold in “pockets”
and “streaks” in the sand there must somewhere
near be “a mother lode.” Flapjack confessed to
having spent weeks looking for that mother lode
about Freezeout Camp. It had never been discovered.
</p>
<p>
“And after the Chinks got through with this
here place, you couldn’t find a pinch of placer gold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
big enough t’ fill your pipe,” the old prospector announced.
“I reckon she’s here somewhere; but
there won’t nobody find her now.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth saw some things that made her wonder if
somebody had not been looking for gold here
much more recently than Flapjack Peters supposed.
In three separate places beside the brawling
stream that ran down the gorge, it seemed to
her the heaped up sand was still wet. She knew
about “cradling”—that crude manner of separating
gold from the soil; and it seemed to her as
though somebody had recently tried for “color”
along the edge of this stream.
</p>
<p>
However, Ruth Fielding’s mind was fixed upon
something far different from placer mining. She
was brooding over a motion picture, and she was
determined to turn out a better scenario than she
had ever before written.
</p>
<p>
Hazel Gray, whom Ruth and her chum, Helen,
had met a year and a half before, and who had
played the heroine’s part in “The Heart of a
Schoolgirl,” was to come on with Mr. Hammond
and his company to play the chief woman’s part in
the new drama. For there was to be a strong love
interest in the story, and that thread of the plot
was already quite clear in Ruth’s mind.
</p>
<p>
She had recently, however, considered Min
Peters as a foil for Hazel Gray. Min was exactly
the type of girl to fit into the story of “The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
Forty-Niners. As for her ability to act——
</p>
<p>
“There is no girl who can’t act, if she gets the
chance, I am sure,” thought Ruth. “Only, some
can act better than others.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth really had little doubt about Min’s ability
to play the part that she had thought out for her.
Only, would she do it? Would she feel that her
own character and condition in life was being held
up to ridicule? Ruth had to be careful about
that.
</p>
<p>
On returning to the camp she said nothing about
the discoveries she had made along the bank of
the stream. But that evening, after supper, as
the whole party were grouped before the cabins
they had now made fairly comfortable, Trix Davenport
suddenly startled them all by crying:
</p>
<p>
“See there! Who’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s where, Trixie?” asked Jennie, lazily.
“Are you seeing things?”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly am,” said the diminutive girl.
</p>
<p>
“So do I!” Sally exclaimed. “There’s a man
on horseback.”
</p>
<p>
In the purple dusk they saw him mounting a
distant ridge east of the stream—almost on the
confines of the valley on that side. It was only
for a minute that he held in his horse and seemed
to be gazing down at the fire flickering in the principal
street of Freezeout Camp.
</p>
<p>
Then he rode on, out of sight.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—NEW ARRIVALS</h2>
<p>
“‘The lone horseman riding into the purple
dusk,’ à la the sensational novelist,” chuckled Jennie
Stone. “Who do you suppose that was, Min?”
</p>
<p>
“Dunno,” declared the Yucca girl. But it was
plain she was somewhat disturbed by the appearance
of the horseman. And so was Flapjack.
</p>
<p>
They whispered together over their own fire,
and Flapjack warned Tom Cameron to be sure
that his automatic was well oiled and that he kept
it handy during his turn at watching the camp that
night.
</p>
<p>
Morning came, however, without anything
more threatening than the almost continuous howling
of a coyote.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, who wandered about a little by herself the
second day at Freezeout, saw Flapjack go over to
the ridge where they had seen the lone horseman.
He came back, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
“Who was the man, Mr. Peters?” she asked
him curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Dunno, Miss. He ain’t projectin’ around here
now, that’s sure. His pony done took him away
from there on a gallop. But there ain’t many single
men that’s honest hoverin’ about these parts.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked the surprised
Ruth. “That only married men are to be trusted
in Arizona?”
</p>
<p>
He grinned at her. “You’re some joker, Miss,”
he replied. Then, seeing that the girl was genuinely
puzzled, he added: “I mean that ‘nless a
man’s got something to be ‘fraid of, he usually has
a partner in these regions. ’Tain’t healthy to
prospect round alone. Something might happen
to you—rock fall on you, or you git took sick, and
then there ain’t nobody to do for you, or for to
ride for the doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“Men that’s bein’ chased by the sheriff, on
t’other hand,” went on Flapjack, frankly, “sometimes
prefers to be alone. You git me?”
</p>
<p>
“I understand,” admitted the girl of the Red
Mill. “But don’t let Miss Cullam hear you say it.
She will be determined to start back for the railroad
at once, if you do.”
</p>
<p>
Flapjack promised to say nothing to disturb
the rest of the party, and Ruth knew she could
trust Min’s good judgment. But she began to
worry in her own mind about who the strange
horseman could be, and about his business near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
Freezeout Camp. She naturally connected the
unknown with the traces she had seen of recent
placer washings and with the campfire the ashes
of which had been warm when her party arrived.
</p>
<p>
With these suspicions, those that had centered
about Edith Phelps in Ruth’s mind, began to be
connected. She could not explain it. It did not
seem possible that the Ardmore sophomore could
have any real interest in the making of this picture
of “The Forty-Niners.” Yet, why had Edith
come into the Hualapai Range?
</p>
<p>
Why Edith had kept Ann Hicks from meeting
her friends as soon as they arrived at Yucca was
more easily understood. Edith wished to get
ahead of Ruth’s party on the trail without her
presence in Arizona being known to the freshman
party.
</p>
<p>
But why, <em>why</em> had she come? The perplexing
question returned to Ruth Fielding’s mind time
and again.
</p>
<p>
And the man who had met Edith and with
whom she had presumably ridden away from
Handy Gulch—who could <em>he</em> be? Had the two
come to Freezeout Camp, and were they lingering
about the vicinity now? Was the stranger on
horseback revealed against the skyline the evening
before, Edith Phelps’ comrade?
</p>
<p>
“If I take any of the girls into my confidence
about this,” thought Ruth, “it will not long be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
secret. Perhaps, too, I might frighten them needlessly.
Surely Edith, and whoever she is with,
cannot mean us any real harm. Better keep still
and see what comes of it.”
</p>
<p>
It bothered her, however. And it coaxed her
mind away from the important matter of the
scenario. However, she was doing pretty well
with that and Rebecca had several scenes of the
first two episodes ready for Mr. Hammond.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon, while she was absorbed in
sketching out the third episode of her scenario, and
Rebecca was beating the typewriter keys in busy
staccato, Helen came running from the far end
of the camp and burst into the sanctum sanctorum
in wild disorder.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded her chum, almost
angry at Helen’s thoughtlessness. “Don’t
you know that I am supposed to be ‘dead to the
world’?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie, forgive me! But I had to tell you
at once. There’s a strange woman about the
camp. Miss Cullam and I both saw her.”
</p>
<p>
“A strange woman!” repeated Ruth. “I’m
sure Miss Cullam didn’t send you hotfoot to tell
me.”
</p>
<p>
“No-o. But I had to tell you—I just <em>had</em> to,”
Helen declared. “Don’t be mean, Ruthie. Do
take an interest in something besides your old
movie picture.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, I am interested,” admitted Ruth. “But
who is this strange woman?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” exclaimed Helen. “That’s just
what’s the matter. We don’t know. We didn’t
see her face. She had a big shawl—or a Navajo
blanket—around her.”
</p>
<p>
“An Indian squaw!” exclaimed Rebecca who
could not help hearing. “I’d like to see one myself.”
</p>
<p>
“We-ell, maybe she was an Indian squaw,” admitted
Helen, slowly. “But why did she run from
us?”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid of you,” chuckled Ruth. “I expect to
the eyes of the untutored savage you and Miss Cullam
looked perfectly awful.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
“But why bring your conundrums to me—just
when I am busiest, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I never! I thought you might be interested,”
sniffed Helen.
</p>
<p>
“I am, dear. But don’t you see that your
news is so—er—<em>sketchy?</em> I might be perfectly
enthralled about this Indian squaw if I really met
her. Capture her and bring her into camp.”
</p>
<p>
Helen went off rather offended. As it happened,
it was Ruth herself who was destined to
learn more about the mysterious woman, as well
as the lone horseman. But much happened before
that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
Before the end of the week Mr. Hammond
rode into Freezeout with a nondescript outfit, including
a dozen workmen prepared to put the old
camp into shape for the making of the great film.
</p>
<p>
The old camp became a busy place immediately.
Flapjack Peters “came out strong,” as his daughter
expressed it, at this juncture. His memory of
old times at these very diggings and at similar
mines proved to be keen, and he became a valuable
aid to Mr. Hammond.
</p>
<p>
Four days later the wagons appeared and the
girls got their trunks. That very night there was
a “regular party” in one of the old saloons and
dancehalls that chanced, even after all these years,
to be habitable.
</p>
<p>
One of the teamsters had brought his fiddle, and
at the prospect of a dance, even with the paucity
of men, the Ardmore girls were delighted. But,
to tell the truth, the “party” was arranged more
for the sake of Min Peters than for aught else.
</p>
<p>
“She’s got to get used to wearing fit clothes before
those movie people come,” Ann Hicks said
firmly. “You leave it to me, girls. I know how
to coax her on.”
</p>
<p>
And Ann proved the truth of her statement.
Not that Min was not eager to see herself “all
dolled up,” as Jennie called it, in one of the two
big mirrors the wagons had brought along for
use in the actresses’ dressing cabins. But she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
fiercely independent, and to suggest that she accept
the college girls’ frocks and furbelows as gifts
would have angered her.
</p>
<p>
But Ann induced her to “borrow” the things
needed, and from the trunks of all were obtained
the articles necessary to make Min Peters appear
at the party as well dressed as any girl need be.
Nor was she so awkward as some had feared.
</p>
<p>
“And pretty was no name for it.”
</p>
<p>
“See there!” cried Helen, under her breath, to
her chum. “The girl is cutting you out, Ruth,
with old Tommy-boy. He’s asked her to dance.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth only smiled at this. She had put Tom up
to that herself, for she learned from Ann that the
Yucca girl knew how to dance.
</p>
<p>
“Of course she can. There is scarcely a girl
in the West who doesn’t dance. Goodness,
Ruthie! don’t you remember how crazy they were
for dancing around Silver Ranch, and the fun we
had at the schoolhouse dance at The Crossing?
Maybe we ain’t on to all those new foxtrots and
tangos; but we can <em>dance</em>.”
</p>
<p>
So it proved with Min. She flushed deeply
when Tom asked her, and she hesitated. Then,
seeing the other girls whirling about the floor,
two and two, the temptation to “show ’em” was
too much. She accepted Tom’s invitation and the
young fellow admitted afterward that he had
danced with “a lot worse girls back East.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
Before the evening was over, Min was supremely
happy. And perhaps the effect on her
father was quite as important as upon Min herself.
For the first time in her life he saw his daughter
in the garb of girls of her age—saw her as she
should be.
</p>
<p>
“By mighty!” the man muttered, staring at
Min. “I don’t git it—not right. Is that sure ‘nuff
my girl?”
</p>
<p>
“You should be proud of her,” said Mr. Hammond,
who heard the old-timer say this. “She deserves
a lot from you, Peters. I understand she’s
been your companion on all your prospecting trips
since her mother died.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right. She’s been the old man’s best
friend. She’s skookum. But I had no idee she’d
look like that when she was fussed up same’s other
girls. She’s been more like a boy to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, she’s no boy, you see,” Mr. Hammond
said dryly.
</p>
<p>
Out of the dance, however, Ruth gained her desire.
She explained to Min that she needed just
her to make the motion picture complete. And
Min, bashfully enough but gratefully, agreed to
act the part of the “lookout” in the “palace of
pleasure” afterward appearing in a girl’s garb in
the hotel parlor.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was deep in her story now and could give
attention to little else. Mr. Grimes and the motion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
picture company would arrive in a week,
and by that time the several important buildings
would be ready and the main street of Freezeout
appear as it had been when the placer diggings
were in full swing.
</p>
<p>
Something happened before the company arrived,
however, which was of an astounding nature.
Ruth, riding with Helen and Jennie one
afternoon east of the camp, came upon the ridge
where the lone horseman had been observed. And
here, overhanging the gorge, was a place where
the quartz ledge had been laid bare by pick and
shovel.
</p>
<p>
“See that rock, girls? Look, how it sparkles!”
said Helen. “Suppose it should be a vein of
gold?”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose it <em>is!</em>” cried Jennie, scrambling off her
horse.
</p>
<p>
“‘Fools’ gold,’ more likely, girls,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“What is that?” demanded Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“Pyrites. But we might take some samples and
show them to Flapjack.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose that old fellow actually knows
gold-bearing quartz when he sees it?” asked
Helen, in doubt.
</p>
<p>
They picked up several pieces of the broken
rock, and that evening after supper showed Peters
and Min their booty. Flapjack actually turned
pale when he saw it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where’d you git this, Miss?” he asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it isn’t two miles from here,” said the
girl of the Red Mill. “What do you think of it?”
</p>
<p>
“I think this here is a placer diggin’s,” said
Peters, slowly. “But it’s sure that wherever
there’s placer there must be a rock-vein where the
gold washed off, or was ground off, ages and ages
ago. D’you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes!” cried Helen, breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! suppose we have found gold!” murmured
Jennie, quite as excited as Helen.
</p>
<p>
“The rock-vein ain’t never been found around
here,” said Flapjack. “I know, for I’ve hunted it
myself. Both banks of the crick, up an’ down,
have been s’arched——”
</p>
<p>
“But suppose this was found a good way from
the stream?”
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe so,” said the old prospector. “The
crick might ha’ shifted its bed a dozen times since
the glacier age. We don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“But how shall we find out if this rock is any
good?” asked Jennie, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Hammond’s goin’ to send a man out to
Handy Gulch with mail to-morrow,” said the prospector.
“He’ll send these samples to the assayer
there. He’ll send back word whether it’s good for
anything or not. But I tell you right now, ladies.
If I’m any jedge at all, that ore’ll assay a hundred
an’ fifty dollars to the ton—or nothin’.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—THE MAN IN THE CABIN</h2>
<p>
Why, of course they could not keep it to
themselves! At least, the three girls could not.
They simply had to tell Miss Cullam and Tom,
and the other Ardmore freshmen and Ann of their
discovery.
</p>
<p>
So every day after that the visitors from the
East “went prospecting.” They searched up and
down the creek for several miles, turning over
every bit of “sparkling” rock they saw and bringing
back to the camp innumerable specimens of
quartz and mica, until Mr. Hammond declared
they were all “gold mad.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, this place has been petered out for years
and years,” he said. “Do you suppose I want my
actors leaving me to stake out claims along Freezeout
Creek, and spoiling my picture? Stop it!”
</p>
<p>
The idea of gold hunting had got into the girls,
however, as well as into Flapjack Peters and his
daughter. The other Western men laughed at
them. Gold this side of the Hualapai Range had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
“petered out.” They looked upon the old-timer
as a little cracked on the subject. And, of course,
these “tenderfoots” did not know anything about
“color” anyway.
</p>
<p>
Even Miss Cullam searched along the creek
banks and up into the low hills that surrounded
the valley.
</p>
<p>
“Who knows,” said the teacher of mathematics,
“but that I may find a fortune, and so be able
to eschew the teaching of the young for the rest
of my life? Gorgeous!”
</p>
<p>
“But pity the ‘young’,” begged Jennie Stone.
“Think, Miss Cullam, how we would miss you.”
</p>
<p>
“I can hardly imagine that you would suffer,”
declared the mathematics teacher. “Really!”
</p>
<p>
“We might not miss the mathematics,” said Rebecca,
wickedly. “But you are the very best chaperon
who ever ‘beaued’ a party of girls into the
wilds. Isn’t that the truth, Ardmores?”
</p>
<p>
“It is!” they cried. “Hurrah for Miss Cullam!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth, however, despite the discovery of the possibly
gold-bearing quartz, was not to be coaxed
from her work. Each morning she shut herself
into the “sanctum sanctorum” and worked faithfully
at the scenario. Likewise, Rebecca stuck to
the typewriter, for she had work to do for Mr.
Hammond now, as well as for Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Some part of each afternoon Ruth took for exercise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
in the open. And usually she took this exercise
on ponyback.
</p>
<p>
Riding alone out of the shallow gorge one day,
she struck into what seemed to her a bridlepath
which led into “dips” and valleys in the hills which
she had never before seen. Nothing more had
been observed of either the lone horseman or the
supposed squaw for so many days that their presence
about Freezeout Camp had quite slipped
Ruth Fielding’s mind.
</p>
<p>
Besides, there were so many men at the camp
now that to have fear of strangers was never in
the girl’s thoughts. She urged her hardy pony
into a gallop and sped down hill and up in a most
invigorating dash.
</p>
<p>
Such a ride cleared the cobwebs out of her head
and revivified mind and body alike. At the end of
this dash, when she halted the pony in an arroyo
to breathe, she was cheerful and happy and ready
to laugh at anything.
</p>
<p>
She laughed first at her own nose! It really was
ridiculous to think that she smelled wood smoke.
</p>
<p>
But the pungent odor of burning wood grew
more and more distinct. She gazed swiftly all
around her, seeing no campfire, of course, in this
shallow gulch. But suddenly she gathered up the
bridle reins tightly and stared, wide-eyed, off to the
left. A faint column of blue smoke rose into the
air—she could not be mistaken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a pretty kettle of fish!” thought Ruth.
“Another camping party? Who can be living so
near Freezeout without giving us a call? The
lone horseman? The Indian squaw? Or both?”
</p>
<p>
She half turned her pony to ride back. It might
be some ill-disposed person camping here in secret.
Flapjack and Min had intimated there were occasionally
ne’er-do-wells found in the range—outlaws,
or ill-disposed Indians.
</p>
<p>
Still, it was cowardly to run from the unknown.
Ruth had tasted real peril on more than one occasion.
She touched the spur to her pony instead
of pulling him around, and rode on.
</p>
<p>
There was a curve in the arroyo and when she
came into the hidden part of the basin the mystery
was instantly explained. A fairly substantial
cabin—recently built it was evident—stood near a
thicket of mesquite. The door was hung on
leather hinges and was wide open. Yet there must
be some occupant, for the smoke rose through the
hole in the roof. It struck Ruth, for several reasons,
that the cabin had been built by an amateur.
</p>
<p>
She held in her pony again and might, after all,
have wheeled him and ridden away without going
closer, if the little beast had not betrayed her presence
by a shrill whinny. Immediately the pony’s
challenge was answered from the mesquite where
the unknown’s horse was picketed.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was startled again. No sound came from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
the cabin, nor could she discover anybody watching
her from the jungle. She rode nearer to the
cabin door.
</p>
<p>
It was then that the unshod hoofs of her pony
announced her presence to whoever was within.
A voice shouted suddenly:
</p>
<p>
“Hullo!”
</p>
<p>
The tone in which the word was uttered drove
all the fear out of Ruth Fielding’s mind. She
knew that the owner of such a voice must be a gentleman.
</p>
<p>
She rode her pony up to the open door and
peered into the dimly lighted interior. There was
no window in the cabin walls.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo yourself!” she rejoined. “Are you all
alone?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure I am. I’m a hermit—the Hermit Prospector.
And I bet you are one of those moving
picture girls.”
</p>
<p>
A laugh accompanied the words. Ruth then
saw the man, extended at full length in a rude
bunk. One foot was bare and it and the ankle
was swathed in bandages.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry I can’t get up to do the honors. Doctor’s
ordered me to stay in bed till this ankle recovers.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Is it broken?” cried Ruth, slipping out
of her saddle and throwing the reins on the ground
before the pony so that he would stand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wrenched. But a bad one. I’m likely to stay
here a while.”
</p>
<p>
“And all alone?” breathed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Quite so. Not a soul to swear at, nor a cat to
kick. My horse is out there in the mesquite and
I suppose he’s tangled up——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll fix that in a moment,” cried Ruth. “He’d
better be tethered here on the hillside before your
door. The grazing is good.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—yes. I suppose so.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was off into the mesquite in a flash. She
found the whinnying pony. And she discovered
another thing. The animal’s lariat had been untangled
and his grazing place changed several
times.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve hobbled around a good bit since your
ankle was hurt,” she said accusingly, when she returned
to the cabin door. “And see all the firewood
you’ve got!”
</p>
<p>
“I expect I did too much after I strained the
ankle,” the man admitted gravely. “That’s why
it is so bad now. But when a man’s alone——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. When he <em>is</em> alone,” repeated Ruth, eyeing
him thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
He was a young man and as roughly dressed
as any of the teamsters at Freezeout Camp.
There was, too, several days’ growth of beard
upon his face. But he was a good looking chap,
with rather a humorous cast of countenance. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
Ruth was quite sure that he was educated and at
present in a strange environment.
</p>
<p>
“Have you plenty of water?” she asked suddenly,
for she had seen the spring several rods
away.
</p>
<p>
“Lots,” declared “the hermit.” “See! I’ve a
drip.”
</p>
<p>
He pointed with pride to the arrangement of a
rude shelf beside the head of his bunk with a
twenty-quart galvanized pail upon it. A pin-hole
had been punched in this pail near the bottom, and
the water dripped from the aperture steadily into
a pint cup on the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Would you believe it,” he said, with a smile,
“the water, after falling so far through the air,
is quite cooled.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you do when the pail is empty?” the
girl asked quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I shall be able to hobble to the spring by
that time. If the cup gets full and I don’t need
the water, I pour it back.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth stood on tiptoe and looked into the pail.
Then she brought water from the spring in her
own canteen, making several trips, and filled the
pail to the brim.
</p>
<p>
“Now, what do you eat, and how do you get
it?” she asked him.
</p>
<p>
“My dear young lady!” he cried, “you must not
worry about me. I shall be all right. I was just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
going to cook some bacon when you rode up. That
is why I made up a fresh fire. I shall be all right,
I assure you.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth insisted upon rumaging through his stores
and cooking the hermit a hearty meal. She
marked the fact that certain delicacies were here
that the ordinary prospector would not have
packed into the wilds. Likewise, there was vastly
more tea and sugar than one person could use in a
long time.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was quite sure “the hermit” was not a native
of the West. She was exceedingly puzzled as
she went about her kindly duties. Then, of a
sudden, she was actually startled as well as puzzled.
In a corner of the cabin she found hanging
on a nail a rubber bathcap on which was stenciled
“Ardmore.” It was one of the gymnasium
caps from her college.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—RUTH REALLY HAS A SECRET</h2>
<p>
Ruth Fielding came back from her ride to
Freezeout Camp and said not a word to a soul
about her discovery of the young man in the cabin.
She had a secret at last, but it was not her own.
She did not feel that she had the right to speak
even to Helen about it.
</p>
<p>
She was quite sure “the hermit” had no ill intention
toward their party. And if he had a companion
that companion could do those at Freezeout
no harm.
</p>
<p>
Just what it was all about Ruth did not know;
yet she had some suspicions. However, she rode
out to the lone cabin the next day, and the next, to
see that the young man was comfortable. “The
Hermit Prospector,” as he laughingly called himself,
was doing very well.
</p>
<p>
Ruth brought him two slim poles out of the
wood and he fashioned himself a pair of crutches.
By means of these he began to hobble around and
Ruth decided that he did not need her further ministrations.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
She did not tell him that she should
cease calling, she merely ceased riding that way.
For a “hermit” he had seemed very glad, indeed,
to have somebody to speak to.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was exceedingly busy now. The director,
Mr. Grimes—a very efficient but unpleasant man—arrived
with the remainder of the company, and
rehearsals began immediately. Hazel Gray, who
had been so fresh and young looking when Ruth
and Helen first met her at the Red Mill, was beginning
to show the ravages of “film acting.” The
appealing personality which had first brought her
into prominence in motion pictures was now a matter
of “registering.” There was little spontaneity
in the leading lady’s acting; but the part she had to
play in “The Forty-Niners” was far different from
that she had acted in “The Heart of a School
Girl,” an earlier play of Ruth’s.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Grimes was just as unpleasantly sarcastic
as when Ruth first saw him. But he got out of his
people what was needed, although his shouting and
threatening seemed to Ruth to be unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
With Ruth Mr. Grimes was perfectly polite.
Perhaps he knew better than to be otherwise. He
was good enough to commend the scenario, and
although he changed several scenes she had spent
hard work upon, Ruth was sensible enough to see
that he changed them for good cause and usually
for the better.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
He approved of Min’s part in the play, and he
was careful with the Western girl in her scenes.
Min did very well, indeed, and even Flapjack
made his extra three dollars a day on several occasions
when he appeared with the teamsters in
the “rough house” scenes in the night life of the
old-time mining camp.
</p>
<p>
The film actors were not an unpleasant company;
yet after all they were not people who could
adapt themselves to the rude surroundings of the
abandoned camp as easily, even, as did the college
girls. The women were always fussing about
lack of hotel requisites—like baths and electric
lights and maids to wait upon them. The men
complained of the food and the rude sleeping accommodations.
</p>
<p>
Ruth learned something right here: All the girls
from Ardmore save Rebecca Frayne and Ruth
herself came from wealthy families—and Rebecca
was used to every refinement of life. Yet the
Ardmores took the “roughing it” good-naturedly
and never worried their pretty heads about “maid
service” and the like.
</p>
<p>
Some of the film women, seeing Min Peters
about in her usual garb, undertook to treat her
superciliously. They did not make the mistake
twice. Min was perfectly capable of taking care
of herself, and she intended to be treated with respect.
Min was so treated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
Helen Cameron was much amused by the attitude
her brother took toward the leading lady,
Hazel Gray. Miss Gray was not more than two
years older than the twins and when the film actress
had first become known to them Tom had
been instantly attracted. His case of boyish love
had been acute, but brief.
</p>
<p>
For six months the walls of his study at Seven
Oaks were fairly papered with pictures of Hazel
Gray in all manner of poses and characterizations.
The next semester Tom had gone in for well-known
athletes, not excluding many prize fighters,
and the pictures of Miss Gray went into the discard.
</p>
<p>
Now the young actress set out to charm Tom
again. He was the only young personable male
at Freezeout, save the actors themselves, and she
knew them. But Tom gave her just as much attention
as he did Min Peters, for instance, and no
more.
</p>
<p>
There was but one girl in camp to whom he
showed any special attention. He was always at
Ruth’s beck and call if she needed him. Tom
never put himself forward with Ruth, or claimed
more than was the due of any good friend. But
the girl of the Red Mill often told herself that
Tom was dependable.
</p>
<p>
She was not sure that she ever wanted her
chum’s brother to be anything more to her than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
what he was now—a safe friend. She and Helen
had talked so much about “independence” and the
like that it seemed like sheer treachery to consider
for a moment any different life after college than
that they had planned.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was to write plays and sing. Helen was
to improve her violin playing and give lessons.
They would take a studio together in Boston—perhaps
in New York—and live the ideal life of
bachelor girls. Helen desired to support herself
just as much as Ruth determined to support herself.
</p>
<p>
“It is dependence upon man for daily bread and
butter that makes women slaves,” Helen declared.
And Ruth agreed—with some reservations. It
began to look to her as though all were dependent
upon one another in this world, irrespective of
sex.
</p>
<p>
However, Tom was one of those dependable
creatures that, if you wanted him, was right at
hand. Ruth let the matter rest at that and did
not disturb her mind much over questions of personal
growth and expansion, or over the woman
question.
</p>
<p>
Her thought, indeed, was so much taken up with
the picture that was being made that she had little
time to bother with anything else. She almost forgot
the lame young man in the distant cabin and
ceased to wonder as to who his companion might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
be. She certainly had quite forgotten the specimens
of ore which had been sent to the Handy
Gulch assayer’s office until unexpectedly the report
arrived.
</p>
<p>
Helen and Jennie, as well as Peters and his
daughter, were interested in this event. The others
of the Ardmore party had only heard of the
supposed find and had not even seen the uncovered
bit of ledge from which the ore had been taken.
</p>
<p>
“Why, perhaps we are all rich!” breathed Jennie
Stone. “Beyond the dreams of avarice! How
much does he say?”
</p>
<p>
“One hundred and thirty-three dollars to the
ton. And it’s ‘free gold,’” declared Ruth. “It
can be extracted by the cyaniding process. That
can be done on the spot, and cheaply. Where
there is much sulphide in the ore the gold must be
extracted by the hydro-electric process.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Ruth! How did you learn so
much?” gasped Helen.
</p>
<p>
“By using my tongue and ears. What were they
given us for?”
</p>
<p>
“To taste nice things with and drape ‘spit-curls’
over,” giggled Jennie.
</p>
<p>
They went to Peters and Min and displayed the
report. The old prospector could have given
the thing away in the exuberance of his joy if it
had not been for the good sense his daughter displayed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hush up, Pop,” she commanded. “You want
to put all these bum actors on to the strike before
we’ve laid out our own claims? We want to grab
off the cream of this find. You know it must be
rich.”
</p>
<p>
“Rich? Say, girl, rich ain’t no name for it.
I know what this Freezeout proposition was when
it was placer diggings. Where so much dust and
nuggets come from along a crick bed, we knowed
there must be a regular mother lode somewheres
here. Only we never supposed it was on that side
of the stream an’ so far away. It looked like the
old bed of the crick lay to the west.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ve got it! A hundred and thirty-three
dollars per ton at the grass-roots. Lawsy!
No knowin’ how deep the ledge is. An’ you ladies
only took specimens in one spot. We want
to take others clean acrosst the ledge—as far as
we kin trace it—git ’em assayed, then pick out the
best claims before any of these cheapskates
around here can ring in on it. Laugh at <em>me</em>, will
they? I reckon they’ll find out that Flapjack is
wuth something as a prospector after all.”
</p>
<p>
He quite overlooked the fact that the three college
girls had found the ore—and that somebody
had uncovered the ledge before them! But Min
did not forget these very pertinent facts.
</p>
<p>
“We got to get a hustle on us,” she announced.
“No knowin’ who ’twas that first opened that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
prospect, Pop. Mebbe he was green, or he ain’t
had his samples assayed yet. We got to get in
quick.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” agreed Flapjack.
</p>
<p>
“And the best three claims has got to go to
Miss Ruth and Miss Cam’ron and Miss Stone.
They found the place. You an’ I, Pop, ‘ll stake
out the next best claims. Then the rush kin come.
But we want to git more samples assayed first.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that necessary?” Ruth asked, quite as eager
as the others now. Somehow the gold hunting
fever gets into one’s blood and effervesces. It was
hard for any of them to keep their jubilation from
the knowledge of the whole camp.
</p>
<p>
“We dunno how long this ledge of gold-bearing
rock is,” Min explained. “Maybe we only struck
the poorest end of it. P’r’aps it’ll run two hundred
dollars or more to the ton at the other end.
We want to stake off our claims where the ore is
richest, don’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s stake it <em>all</em> off,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t hold it. Not by law. These big
minin’ companies git so many claims because they
buy up options from different locaters all along a
ledge. There’s ha’f a hundred claims belongs to
the Arepo Company, for instance, at one workin’s.
No. We’ve got to be careful and keep this secret
till we’re sure where the best of the ore lays.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s go at once and see!” cried Jennie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go this afternoon,” Ruth said. “All five
of us.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope nobody will find the place before we
get there,” Helen observed.
</p>
<p>
“No more likely now than ’twas before,” Min
said sensibly. “Pop’ll sneak out a pick and shovel
for us, and meet us over there on the ridge.”
</p>
<p>
So it was arranged. But the three college girls
were so excited that they were scarcely fit for
either work or play. They set off eagerly into the
hills after lunch and met Flapjack and his daughter
as had been appointed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—SOMETHING UNEXPECTED</h2>
<p>
The old prospector was wild with joy. He had
already dug several holes down to the surface of
the ledge along the ridge north of the spot where
the first sample of gold-bearing rock had been secured.
He claimed that each spot showed an increase
in the amount of gold in the rock.
</p>
<p>
“It’s ha’f a mile long, I bet. An’ the farther
you go, the richer it gits. I tell you, we’re goin’
all to be as rich as red mud! Whoop!”
</p>
<p>
“Hold in your hosses, Pop,” commanded Min,
sensibly. “Them folks down in camp may see you
prancin’ around here, and they’ll either think you
are crazy or know that you’ve struck pay dirt.
And we don’t want ’em in on this yet.”
</p>
<p>
“By mighty! Listen here, girl!” gasped the
old man. “We’re goin’ to be rich, you and me.
You’re goin’ to dress in the fanciest clo’es there
is. You’ll look a lot finer than that there leadin’
lady actress girl. Believe me!”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Pop, be sensible!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’re a-goin’ to be a lady,” declared Flapjack.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Me, a lady, with them han’s?” and she
put forth both her calloused palms. “A fat chance
I got!”
</p>
<p>
With tears in her eyes Ruth Fielding said:
“Those hands have earned the right to be a
’lady’s’, Min. If there is gold here in quantity,
you shall be all that your father says.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course she shall!” cried the other college
girls in chorus.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’ll kill me, I know that,” declared Min.
“I’d just about bust wide open with joy.”
</p>
<p>
Flapjack dug seven holes that afternoon, and
they took seven specimens of the rock with the
bright specks in it. The college girls thought they
could detect an increasing amount of gold in the
ore as they advanced up the ledge.
</p>
<p>
The old prospector insisted upon filling in each
hole as they went along and putting back the tufts
of bunch grass in order to make the place look as
it ordinarily did. Tiny numbered stakes driven
down into the loose and gravelly soil was all that
marked the places from which the specimens were
taken. Of course, the specimens themselves were
properly marked, too.
</p>
<p>
The gold seemed to be right at the grass-roots,
as Flapjack had said. He told them the ledge was
all of twenty yards wide, with the width increasing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
as the value of the ore increased. The full
length of the ledge was still unexplored, but the
depth of the vein of gold-bearing quartz was really
the “unknown dimension.”
</p>
<p>
“But we’re going to be rich, girls!” whispered
Jennie Stone, almost dancing, as they went back
to the camp at dusk. “Rich! why, I’ve always
been rich—or, my father has. I never thought
much about it. But to own a real gold mine oneself!”
</p>
<p>
The thought was too great for utterance. Besides,
they had agreed not to whisper about the
find at the camp. Not even Miss Cullam knew
that the report had come from the assayer regarding
the first specimen of ore the girls had found.
</p>
<p>
It was not hard to hide their excitement, for
there was so much going on at Freezeout Camp.
Mr. Grimes was trying to rush the work as much
as possible, for the picture actors were complaining
constantly regarding their trials and the manifold
privations of the situation.
</p>
<p>
The college girls and Ann Hicks, however, were
having the time of their lives. They dressed up
in astonishing apparel furnished by the film company
and posed as the female populace of Freezeout
Camp in some of the episodes. Min, in the
part Ruth had especially written for her, was a
pronounced success. Miss Gray, of course, as
she always did, filled the character of the heroine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
“to the queen’s taste”—and to Mr. Grimes’ satisfaction
as well, which was of much more importance.
</p>
<p>
The weather was just the kind the “sun worshippers”
delighted in. The camera man could
grind his machine for six hours a day or more.
The film of “The Forty-Niners” grew steadily.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had practically finished her part of the
work; but Rebecca Frayne was kept busy at her
typewriter during part of the day. Therefore,
Ruth easily got away from the sanctum sanctorum
the next forenoon and went up to the ridge again
with Flapjack and Min.
</p>
<p>
It had been settled that Helen and Jennie should
remain with the other girls and keep them from
wandering about on the easterly side of the stream.
</p>
<p>
Flapjack had been on the ridge since early light.
He was taking samples every few rods, and Min
was wrapping them up and marking the ore and
the stakes. Beyond a small grove of scrubby trees
they came in sight of what Flapjack declared was
probably the end of the gold-bearing rock. There
was a dip into another arroyo and beyond that a
mesquite jungle as far as they could see.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she’s more’n a ha’f a mile long,” sighed
the old prospector. “Ev’ry thing’s got to come
to an end in this world they say. We needn’t grow
bristles about it—— Great cats! What’s them?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Pop!” shrieked Min, “We ain’t here first.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> those stakes?” asked Ruth, puzzled
to see that the peeled posts planted in the gravelly
soil should so disturb the equanimity of the prospector
and his daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody’s ahead of us. Two claims staked,”
groaned Flapjack. “And layin’ over the best
streak of ore in the whole ledge, I bet my
hat!”
</p>
<p>
There were two scraps of paper on the posts.
Min ran forward to read the names upon them.
Flapjack rested on his pick and said no further
word.
</p>
<p>
Of a sudden Ruth heard the sharp ring of a
pony’s hoof on gravel. She turned swiftly to see
the pony pressing through the mesquite at the foot
of the ridge. Its rider urged the animal up the
slope and in a moment was beside them.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing on my claim and my partner’s?”
the man demanded, and he slid out of his
saddle gingerly, slipping rude crutches under his
armpits as he came to the ground. He had one
foot bandaged, and hobbled toward Ruth and her
companions with rather a truculent air.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing on my claim?” “the hermit”
repeated, and he was glaring so intently at
Flapjack that he did not see Ruth at all.
</p>
<p>
The prospector was smoking his pipe, and he
nearly dropped it as he stared in turn at this odd-looking
figure on crutches. It was easy enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
see that the claimant to the best options on Freezeout
ledge was a tenderfoot.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t on your claim,” growled Peters at last.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that other fellow is,” declared “the hermit,”
“Let me tell you that my partner’s gone
to Kingman to have the claims recorded. They
are so by this time. If you try to jump ’em——”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s tryin’ to jump anything?” demanded
Min, now coming back from examining the notices
on the stakes. “Which are you—this here ‘E’
or ‘R’yal?’”
</p>
<p>
“Royal is my name,” said the man, gruffly.
</p>
<p>
“Brothers, I s’pose?” said Min.
</p>
<p>
The young man stared at her wonderingly. “I
declare!” he finally exclaimed. “You’re a girl,
aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“No matter who or what I am,” said Min
Peters, tartly. “You needn’t think you can stake
out all this ledge just because you found it first—maybe.”
</p>
<p>
It was evident that both Flapjack and his daughter
considered the appearance of this claimant to
the supposedly richest options on the ledge most
unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
“I know my rights and the law,” said the young
man quite as truculently as before. “If it’s necessary
I’ll stay here and watch those stakes till my—my
partner gets back with the men and machinery
that are hired to open up these claims.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“By mighty!” groaned Flapjack. “The hull
thing will be spread through Arizony in the shake
of a sheep’s hind laig.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what of it? You can stake out claims
as we did,” snapped “the hermit.” “We are not
trying to hog it all.”
</p>
<p>
“These men you’re bringin’ ‘ll grab off the best
options and sell ’em to you. You’re Easterners.
You’re goin’ to make a showin’ and then sell the
mine to suckers,” said Min bitterly. “We know
all about your kind, don’t we, Pop?”
</p>
<p>
Peters muttered his agreement. Ruth considered
that it was now time for her to say another
word.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure,” she began, “that Mr.—er—Royal
will only do what is fair. And, of course, we want
no more than our rights.”
</p>
<p>
The man with the injured ankle looked at her
curiously. “I’m willing to believe what you say,”
he observed. “You have already been kind to me.
Though you didn’t come back to see me again.
But I don’t know anything about this man and this—er——”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Peters and her father,” introduced Ruth,
briskly, as she saw Min flushing hotly. “And they
must stake off their claims next in running to the
two you and your partner have staked.”
</p>
<p>
“No!” exclaimed Min, fiercely. “You and the
other two young ladies come first. Then pop and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
me. It puts us a good ways down the ledge; but
it’s only fair.”
</p>
<p>
The young man looked much worried. He said
suddenly:
</p>
<p>
“How many more of you are informed of the
existence of this gold ledge?”
</p>
<p>
“After my claim,” said Ruth, firmly, “I am going
to stake out one for Rebecca Frayne. She
needs money more than anybody else in our party—more
even than Miss Cullam. The others can
come along as they chance to.”
</p>
<p>
“Great Heavens!” gasped the young man.
“How many more of you are there? I say! I’ll
make you an offer. What’ll you-all take for your
claims, sight-unseen?”
</p>
<p>
“There! What did I tell you?” grumbled Min
Peters. “He’s one o’ them Eastern promoters
that allus want to skim the cream of ev’rything.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—THE MAD STALLION</h2>
<p>
Somehow Ruth Fielding could not find herself
subscribing to this opinion of “the hermit” so flatly
stated by Min Peters. She begged the prospector’s
daughter to hush.
</p>
<p>
“Let us not say anything to each other that we
will later be sorry for. Of course, we all understand—and
must admit—that the finding of this
gold-bearing ledge is a matter that cannot be long
kept from the general public.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure! There’ll be a rush,” growled Flapjack.
</p>
<p>
“And when this feller’s men git here they’ll hog
it all,” declared Min.
</p>
<p>
“They won’t hog our claims—not unless I’m
dead,” said her father violently.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hush! hush!” cried Ruth again. “This is
no way to talk. We can stake out our claims and
the other girls can stake out theirs. You understand
we honestly found this ore just the same as
you and your partner did?” she added to the lame
young man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“I found it first,” he said, gloomily. “I found
it months ago——”
</p>
<p>
“Great cats!” broke in Flapjack. “Why didn’t
you file on it, then, and git started?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Mr. Royal,” said Ruth, puzzled. “Why
the delay?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, I hadn’t any money. I had to
write to—to my partner. Ahem! I had to get
money through my partner. I was afraid to file
on the claim for fear the news would spread and
the whole ridge be overrun with prospectors before
I could be sure of mine.”
</p>
<p>
“And what you considered yours was the cream
of it all,” repeated Min, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Well! I found it, didn’t I?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“We were going to do the same thing ourselves,”
Ruth said. “Let us be fair, Min.”
</p>
<p>
“But this feller means to git it all,” snapped the
prospector’s daughter, nodding at “the hermit.”
</p>
<p>
“It means a lot to me—this business,” the young
man muttered. “More than I can tell you. <em>It
means everything to me</em>.”
</p>
<p>
He spoke so earnestly that the trio felt uncomfortable.
Even Min did not seem able to ask another
personal question. Her father drawled:
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me I seen you ’round Yucca, didn’t
I, Mister?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I stayed there for a while. With a man
named Braun.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yep. Out on the trail to Kaster.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said “the hermit.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated Ruth, suddenly. “Was his
rural delivery box number twenty-four?”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked “the hermit.” “Yes, it was.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth opened her lips again; then she shut them
tightly. She would not speak further of this subject
before Flapjack and Min.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” the latter said irritably. “No use
standin’ here all day. We’re goin’ to stake out
them claims and put up notices. And we don’t
want ’em teched, neither.”
</p>
<p>
“If mine are not touched you may be sure I shall
not interfere with yours,” said the young man
stiffly, turning his back on them and hobbling to
his waiting pony.
</p>
<p>
Ruth wanted to say something else to him; then
she hesitated. Then the young man rode away,
the crutches dangling over his shoulder by a cord.
</p>
<p>
She left Peters and Min to stake out the claims,
having written the notices for her own, and for
Helen’s and Jennie’s and Rebecca Frayne’s claims
as well. It was agreed that nothing was to be said
at the camp about the find. As soon as she arrived
she took Helen and Jennie aside and warned them.
</p>
<p>
“As Min says, we’ll ‘button up our lips,’” Jennie
said. “Oh, I can keep a secret! But who will
go to Kingman to file on the claims?”
</p>
<p>
That was what was puzzling Ruth. Flapjack,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
who knew all about such things—and knew the
shortest trail, of course—was not to be trusted.
He had money in his pocket and as Min said, a
little money drove the man to drink.
</p>
<p>
“And Min can’t go. She is needed in several
further scenes of the picture,” groaned Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you what,” Helen said eagerly, “we have
just got to take one other person into our confidence.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right,” agreed Ruth. “I know whom
you mean, Nell. Tom, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Tom is perfectly safe,” said Helen. “He
won’t even go up there and stake out a claim for
himself if I tell him not to. But he <em>will</em> rush to
Kingman and file on our claims.”
</p>
<p>
“And take these specimens of ore to the assayer,”
put in Ruth.
</p>
<p>
It was so agreed, and when Min and her father
reappeared at the camp the suggestion was made
to them. Evidently the Western girl had been
much puzzled about this very thing and she hailed
the suggestion with acclaim.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me I ought to be the one to file on
them claims,” Flapjack said slowly. “And takin’
one more into this thing means spreadin’ it out
thinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t trust you to go to Kingman with
money in your pocket,” declared his daughter
frankly. “You know, Pop, you said long ago that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
if ever you did strike it rich you was goin’ to be
a gentleman and cut out all the rough stuff.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right,” admitted Mr. Peters. “Me for
a plug hat and a white vest with a gold watchchain
across it, and a good <em>seegar</em> in my mouth. Yes,
sir! That’s me. And a feller can’t afford to git
’toxicated and roll ’round the streets with them
sort of duds on—no sir! If this is my lucky strike
I’ve sure got to live up to it.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth wondered if clothes were going to make
such a vast difference to both Min and her father.
Yet lesser things than clothes have been elements
of regeneration in human lives.
</p>
<p>
However, it was agreed that Tom must be
taken into the gold hunters’ confidence. He was
certainly surprised and wanted to rush right over
to look at the ridge. But they showed him the
gold-bearing ore instead and he had to be satisfied
with that.
</p>
<p>
For time was pressing. “The hermit’s” partner
might return with a crowd of hired workers and
trouble might ensue. Without doubt Royal and
his mate had intended to open the entire length of
the ledge and gain possession of it. The mining
law made it imperative that the claims should be
of a certain area and each claim must be worked
within so many months. But there are ways of
circumventing the law in Arizona as well as in
other places.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder who that partner of the lame fellow
is?” Ruth murmured, as they were talking it over
while Tom Cameron was making his preparations
for departure.
</p>
<p>
“Same name as R’yal,” said Min, briefly.
“Must be brothers.”
</p>
<p>
This statement rather puzzled Ruth. It certainly
dissipated certain suspicions she had gained
from her visits to the cabin in the distant arroyo,
where “the hermit” lived.
</p>
<p>
Tom left the camp before night, carrying a
good map of the trails to the north as far as Kingman.
He was supposed to be going on some private
errand for himself, and as he had no connection
at all with the moving picture activities his departure
was scarcely noted.
</p>
<p>
Besides, Mr. Grimes and the actors were just
then preparing for one of the biggest scenes to be
incorporated in the film of “The Forty-Niners.”
This was the hold-up of the wagon train by Indians
and it was staged on the old trail leading
south out of Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
The wagons that had carted the paraphernalia
over from Yucca had tops just like the old emigrant
wagons in ‘49. There were only a few real
Indians in Mr. Grimes’ company; but some of the
cowboys dressed in Indian war-dress. For picture
purposes there seemed a crowd of them when the
action took place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
Everybody went out to see the film taken, and
the fight and massacre of the gold hunters seemed
very realistic. Indeed, one part of it came near to
being altogether too realistic.
</p>
<p>
One of the punchers working with the company
had announced before that there was either a
bunch of wild horses in the vicinity, or a lone stallion
strayed from some ranch. The horse in
question had been sighted several times, and its
hoofprints were often seen within half a mile of
Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
The girls, while riding in a party through the
hills, had spied the black and white creature, standing
on a pinnacle and gazing, snorting, down upon
the bridled ponies. The lone horse seemed to be
attracted by those of his breed, yet feared to approach
them while under the saddle. And, of
course, the horses of the outfit were all picketed
near the camp.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the rehearsal of the Indian hold-up,
when the emigrant’s ponies were stampeded
by the redskins, the lone horse appeared and,
snorting and squealing, tried to join the herd of
tame horses and lead them away.
</p>
<p>
“It’s an ‘old rogue’ stallion, that’s what it is,”
Ben Lester, one of the real Indians remarked. He
had been to Harvard and had come back to his
family in Arizona to straighten out business affairs,
and was waiting for the Government to untangle much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
red tape before getting his share
of the Southern Ute grant.
</p>
<p>
“He acts like he was locoed to me,” declared
Felix Burns, the horse wrangler, who, much to his
disgust, had to “act in them fool pitchers” as well
as handle the stock for the outfit. “Looky there!
If he comes for you, beat him off with your quirts.
A bite from him might send man or beast jest as
crazy as a mad dog.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean that the stallion is really mad?”
asked Ruth, who was riding near the Indians, but,
of course, out of the focus of the camera.
</p>
<p>
“Just as mad as a dog with hydrophobia—and
just as dangerous,” declared Ben. “You ladies
keep back. We may have to beat the brute off.
He’s a pretty bird, but if he’s locoed, he’d better
be dead than afoot—poor creature.”
</p>
<p>
The strangely acting stallion did not come near
enough, however, for the boys to use their quirts.
Nor did he bite any of the loose horses. He
seemed to have an idea of leading the pack astray,
that was all; and when the ponies were rounded
up the stallion disappeared again, whistling shrilly,
over the nearest ridge.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—A PERIL OF THE SADDLE</h2>
<p>
Helen and Jennie, as they had promised, kept
away from the ridge where the gold-bearing rock
had been found. But the next afternoon when
Ruth went for a gallop over the hills she chose a
direction that would bring her around to the rear
of the ledge.
</p>
<p>
She left her pony and climbed the hill on foot.
For some distance along the length of the ledge
and toward what was believed to be the richer end,
Flapjack and Min had staked out the claims.
They followed the two staked by the lame young
man and his partner, and “R. Fielding” was on the
notice stuck up on the one next to the claims of the
mysterious young man and his partner.
</p>
<p>
“Well, nobody’s disturbed them, that is sure.
Tom is pounding away just as fast as he can go
for Kingman. Dates and time mean much in establishing
mining claims, I believe. But if Tom
gets to the county office and files on these claims
before this other party can get on the site to jump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
them—if that is what they really mean to do—in
the end we ought to be able to get judgment in the
courts.”
</p>
<p>
Yet, somehow, she could not believe that “the
hermit” was the sort of man who would do anything
crooked. Satisfied that none of the stakes
had been disturbed she returned to her pony and
started him into the east again.
</p>
<p>
In a few moments she found herself following
that half-defined path that she had ridden on the
day she had first seen the secret cabin and the lame
man in it. She had never mentioned this adventure
to any of the girls. Ruth was, by nature, cautious
without being really secretive. And when a
second person was a party to any secret she was
not the girl to chatter.
</p>
<p>
She hesitated, if the pony did not, in following
this route. Half a dozen times she might have
pulled out and taken a side turn, or ridden into
another arroyo and so escaped seeing that hidden
cabin again.
</p>
<p>
It must be confessed, however, that Ruth Fielding
was curious. Very curious indeed. And she
had reason to be. The gymnasium cap she had
seen in “the hermit’s” cabin pointed to a most astounding
possibility. She had not believed in the
first place that “the hermit” was entirely alone in
this wild and lonely spot. Now he had admitted
the existence of a partner. Who was it?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
She was deep in thought as her pony carried her
at an easy canter down into the arroyo at the far
end of which the cabin stood. Suddenly her mount
lifted his head and challenged.
</p>
<p>
“Whoa! what’s the matter with you? What
are you squealing at?” demanded Ruth, tightening
her grasp on the reins.
</p>
<p>
She glanced around and saw nothing at first.
Then the pony squealed again, and as it did so
there came an answering equine hail from the mesquite.
There was a crash in the bushes; then out
upon the open ground charged the lone stallion
that had the day before troubled the picture making
company.
</p>
<p>
There was good blood in the handsome brute.
He was several hands higher than the cow pony,
and his legs were as slender and shapely as a Morgan’s.
His muzzle was as glossy as satin; his nostrils
a deep red and he blew through them and expanded
them with ears pricked forward and yellow
teeth bared—making altogether a striking
picture, but one that Ruth Fielding would much
rather have seen on the screen than here in reality.
</p>
<p>
She raised her quirt and brought it down upon
her pony’s flank. He sprang forward under the
lash but was not quick enough to escape the mad
stallion. That brute got directly in the path and
they collided.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth was almost unseated, while the clashing
teeth of the free horse barely grazed her legging.
He snapped again at the rump of the plunging
pony, but missed.
</p>
<p>
The girl was seriously frightened. What Ben
Lester and the other cowpuncher had said about
the stallion seemed to be true. Did he have hydrophobia
just the same as a dog that runs mad?
</p>
<p>
Whether the beast was afflicted with the rabies
or not, Ruth did not want either herself or the
pony bitten. She had seen enough of half-tamed
horses on Silver Ranch in Montana to know that
there is scarcely an animal more savage than a
wild stallion.
</p>
<p>
And if this black and white beast had eaten of
the loco weed which, in some sections of the Southwest
is quite common, he was much more dangerous
than the bear Min Peters had shot as they
came over from Yucca.
</p>
<p>
She tried to start her pony along the bottom of
the arroyo on the back track; but the squealing
stallion had got around behind them and again
charged with open jaws, the froth flying from his
curled-back lips.
</p>
<p>
So she wheeled her mount, clinging desperately
with her knees to his heaving sides, and once more
lashed him with the quirt.
</p>
<p>
Since she had ridden him that first day out of
Yucca Ruth had been in the saddle almost every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
day since; but so far she had never had occasion
to use the whip on her pony. He was a spirited
bit of horseflesh, not much more than half the
size of the stallion. The quirt embittered him.
</p>
<p>
Although he wheeled to run, facing down the
arroyo again, he began to buck instead. His heels
suddenly were thrown out and just grazed the stallion’s
nose, while Ruth came close to flying out of
her saddle and over his head.
</p>
<p>
If she was once unhorsed Ruth suddenly realized
that her fate would be sealed. The stallion
rose up on his hind legs, squealing and whistling,
and struck at her with his sharp hoofs.
</p>
<p>
It was a moment of grave peril for Ruth
Fielding.
</p>
<p>
Again and again she beat her mount, and again
and again he went up into the air, landing stiff-legged,
and with all four feet close together. Then
she swung the stinging lash across the face of the
stallion.
</p>
<p>
It was a cruel blow and it laid open the satiny,
black skin of the angry brute right across his nose.
He squealed and fell back. The pony whirled and
again Ruth struck at their common enemy.
</p>
<p>
Lashing the stallion seemed a better thing than
punishing her own frightened mount, and as the
mad horse circled her the girl struck again and
again, once cutting open the stallion’s shoulder
and drawing blood in profusion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
The fight was not won so easily, however. The
pony danced around and around trying to keep his
heels to the stallion; the latter endeavored to get
in near enough to use either his fore-hoofs in striking,
or his teeth to tear the girl or her mount.
</p>
<p>
And then Ruth unexpectedly heard a shout.
Somebody at the top of his voice ordered her to
“Lie down on his neck—I’m going to fire!”
</p>
<p>
She saw nothing; she had no idea where this
prospective rescuer stood; but she was wise enough
to obey. She seized the pony’s mane and lay as
close to his neck as possible. The next instant the
report of a heavy rifle drowned even the squealing
of the stallion.
</p>
<p>
He had risen on his hind feet, his fore-hoofs
beating the air, the foam flying from his lips, his
yellow teeth gleaming. A more frightful, threatening
figure could scarcely be imagined, it seemed
to the girl of the Red Mill in her dire peril.
</p>
<p>
At the rifle shot he toppled over backward,
crashing to the earth with a scream that was almost
human. There he lay on his back for a minute.
</p>
<p>
Out of the brush hobbled the young man named
Royal. He was getting around without his
crutches now. The gun in his hand was still smoking.
</p>
<p>
“Have you a rope?” he shouted. “If you have
I’ll noose him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“No. I haven’t a rope, though Ann is always
telling me never to ride without one in this country.”
</p>
<p>
“I think she’s right—whoever Ann is,” said the
young man, with that humorous twist to his features
that Ruth so liked. “A rope out here is
handier than a little red wagon. Come on, quick!
I only creased that stallion. He may not have
had the fight all taken out of him—the ferocious
beast!”
</p>
<p>
The black and white horse was already trying
to struggle to his feet. Perhaps he was not badly
hurt. Ruth controlled her pony, and he was
headed down the arroyo.
</p>
<p>
“Where is your horse, Mr. Royal?” she asked
the lame young man.
</p>
<p>
He started and looked a little oddly at her when
she called him that; but he replied:
</p>
<p>
“My horse is down at the cabin. I was just
trying my legs a little. Glory! I almost turned
my ankle again that time.”
</p>
<p>
He was hobbling pretty badly now, for he had
been too excited while shooting the mad stallion
to be careful of his lame ankle. Ruth was out of
the saddle in a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Get right up here,” she commanded. “We’ll
get to your cabin and be safe. I can go back to
camp by another way.”
</p>
<p>
“Not alone,” he declared, firmly, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
scrambled into her place on the pony. “I’ll ride
with you. That beast is not done for yet.”
</p>
<p>
But the stallion did not pursue them. He stood
rather wabblingly and shook his head, and turned
in slow circles as though he were dazed. The rifle
shot had not, however, permanently injured him.
</p>
<p>
They were quickly out of the sight of the scene
of Ruth’s peril. The young man looked down at
her, trudging hot and dusty beside the pony, and
his face crinkled into a broad smile again.
</p>
<p>
“You’re some girl,” he said. “I’d dearly love
to know your name and just who you are. My—That
is, my partner says you are a bunch of movie
actors over there at Freezeout. But, of course,
that old-timer who was up on the ridge and the girl
in—er—overalls, were not actors. How about
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Ruth, amusedly. “I act. Sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“Get out!”
</p>
<p>
“I did. Out of my saddle to give you my seat.
You should be more polite.”
</p>
<p>
He burst into open laughter at this. “You’re
all right,” he declared. “Do you mind telling me
your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Fielding. Miss Fielding, Mr. Royal.”
</p>
<p>
He grinned at her wickedly. “You’ve got only
half of <em>my</em> name,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed?” she cried. “Yes, I suppose, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
other people, you must have a first name.”
</p>
<p>
“I have a last name,” he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“What?” Ruth gasped. “Isn’t Royal——”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I was christened. Phelps is the
rest of it—Royal Phelps.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew it! I felt it!” declared Ruth, stopping
in the trail and making the pony stop, too. “You
are Edith Phelps’ brother. I was puzzled as I
could be, for I believed, since the first day I met
you, that must be so and that she had been with
you at that cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” he asked curiously, “how did you come
to know my sister?”
</p>
<p>
“Go to college with her,” said Ruth, shortly,
and moving on again. “And she was on the train
with us coming West.”
</p>
<p>
“And you did not know where she was coming?
Of course not! It was a secret.”
</p>
<p>
“She knew where <em>we</em> were coming,” said Ruth,
briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Then you’re not a movie actress?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m a freshman at Ardmore. But I do act—once
in a while. There are a party of us girls
from Ardmore, with one of the teachers, roughing
it at Freezeout Camp. The movie people
are there, too. We are acquainted with them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m mighty sorry my sister isn’t
here——”
</p>
<p>
“Is she your partner, Mr. Phelps?” Ruth asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure thing! And a bully good one. When I
was hurt and couldn’t ride so far, she set off alone
to find her way over the trails to Kingman.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” Ruth cried. “Aren’t you worried about
her? Have you heard——?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a word. But it isn’t time yet. Edith is a
smart girl,” declared the brother with confidence.
“She’ll make it all right. I don’t expect her back
for a week yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! but we expect Tom——”
</p>
<p>
“What Tom?” asked Phelps, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“My chum’s brother. He started—started day
before yesterday—for Kingman to file on our
claims. We expect him back in ten days, or two
weeks at the longest. Why, we shall probably be
all through taking the pictures by that time!”
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Miss Fielding,” said the young
man, his face suddenly gloomy. “Can’t you fix it
so we can buy up your claims along that ridge? It
means a lot to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mr. Phelps!” exclaimed Ruth, “don’t
you suppose it means something to the rest of
us? If it is really a valuable gold deposit.”
</p>
<p>
“Not what it means to me,” he returned
soberly, and rode in silence the rest of the way to
the cabin.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—RUTH HEARS SOMETHING</h2>
<p>
Ruth Fielding was particularly interested in
the situation of “the hermit,” Edith Phelps’
brother. But she was not deeply enough interested
in him or in his desires to give up her own
expectation from the gold-bearing ledge on the
ridge.
</p>
<p>
She remembered very clearly what Helen Cameron
had told her about this young Royal Phelps.
She had not known his name, of course, and the
fact that Min Peters that day on the ridge had
not explained fully what Royal’s last name was,
had caused the girl some further puzzlement.
</p>
<p>
The character the tale about Edith’s brother
had given that young man did not seem to fit this
“hermit” either. This fellow seemed so gentlemanly
and so amusing, that she could scarcely believe
him the worthless character he was pictured.
Yet, his presence here in the wilds, and Edith’s
coming out to him so secretly, pointed to a mystery
that teased the girl of the Red Mill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
When they came to the cabin door, and Royal
Phelps slid carefully out of her saddle, Ruth said
easily:
</p>
<p>
“I wish you’d tell me all about yourself, Mr.
Phelps. I am curious—and frank to say so.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you,” he admitted, smiling suddenly
again—and Ruth thought that smile the
most disarming she had ever seen. Royal Phelps
might have been disgraced at college, but she believed
it must have been through his fun-loving
disposition rather than because of any viciousness.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you for feeling curiosity,” the
young man repeated, seating himself gingerly in
the doorway. “If I had a chair I’d offer it to
you, Miss Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks. I’ll hop on my pony. I’ll get yours
for you before I go.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait a bit,” he urged. “I am going with you
when you return to that town. That wild beast of
a horse may be rampaging around again.”
</p>
<p>
“Ugh!” ejaculated Ruth with no feigned shudder.
“He was awful!”
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve said something! But you are a
mighty cool girl, Miss Fielding. What Edie
would have done——”
</p>
<p>
“She would have done quite as well as I, I have
no doubt,” Ruth hastened to say. “And I have
been in the West before, Mr. Phelps.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes? You are really a movie actor?”
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“And a college girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Always!” laughed his visitor.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you are puzzling me intentionally.”
</p>
<p>
“I told you that I was puzzled about you.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so,” he laughed. “Well, tit for tat.
You tell me and I’ll tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“I trust to your honor,” she said, with mock
seriousness. “I will tell you my secret. Really,
I am not a movie actress—save by brevet.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought not!” he exclaimed with warmth.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they are very nice folk!” Ruth told him.
“Much nicer than you suppose. I am really writing
the scenario Mr. Hammond is producing.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness!” he exclaimed. “A literary person?”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly.”
</p>
<p>
“But why didn’t Edie tell me something about
you? She went over there and took a peep at
you.”
</p>
<p>
“I fancied so. The girls thought her an Indian
squaw. That would please Edie—if I know her
at all,” said Ruth with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to tell her,” he grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Better not. She does not like us any too well.
Us freshmen, I mean. You know,” Ruth decided
to explain, “there is an insurmountable wall between
freshmen and sophs.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ought to know,” murmured Royal Phelps,
and his face clouded.
</p>
<p>
Ruth, determined to get to the root of this mysterious
matter, thrust in a deep probe: “I believe
you have been to college, Mr. Phelps?”
</p>
<p>
He reddened to his ears. “Oh, yes,” he answered
shortly.
</p>
<p>
“And then did you come out here to go into the
mining business?” she continued, with some
cruelty, for he was writhing.
</p>
<p>
“After the pater put me out—yes,” he said,
looking directly at her now, even though his face
flamed.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was doubly assured that Royal Phelps
could not be as black as he was painted.
“Though I do not believe any painter could reflect
the Italian sunset hue that now mantles his
brow,” she thought.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry that you have had trouble with
your father. Is it insurmountable?” she asked
him quietly, and with the air that always gave
even strangers confidence in Ruth Fielding.
</p>
<p>
“I hope not,” he admitted. “I was mad enough
when I came away. I just wanted to ‘show him.’
But now I’d like to <em>show him</em>. Do—do you get
me?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no difference in the words, but a
great deal in the inflection, Mr. Phelps,” Ruth said
quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well. You’re an understandable girl. After
I had come a cropper at Harvard—silly thing,
too, but made the whole faculty wild,” and here
he grinned like a naughty small boy at the remembrance—“the
pater said I wasn’t worth the powder
to blow me to Halifax. And I guess he was
right. But he’d not given me a chance.
</p>
<p>
“Said I’d never done a lick of work and probably
wouldn’t. Said I was cut out for a rich man’s
wastrel or a tramp. Said I shouldn’t be the first
with <em>his</em> money. Told James to show me the
outer portal with the brass plate on it, and bring
in the ‘welcome’ mat so that I wouldn’t stand there
and think it meant <em>me</em>.
</p>
<p>
“So I came away from there,” finished Royal
Phelps with a wry face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that was terrible!” Ruth declared with
clasped hands and all the sympathy that the most
exacting prodigal could expect. “But, of course,
he didn’t mean it.”
</p>
<p>
“Mean it? You don’t know Costigan Phelps.
He never says anything he doesn’t mean. Let me
tell you it won’t be a slippery day when I show up
at the paternal mansion. The pater certainly will
not run out and fall on either my neck or his own.
There’ll be nobody at the home plate to see me
coming and hail me: ‘Kill the fatted prodigal;
here comes the calf!’ Believe me!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Phelps!” begged Ruth. “Don’t talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
that way. I know just how you feel. And you are
trying to hide it——”
</p>
<p>
“With airy persiflage—yes,” he admitted, turning
serious. “Well, pater’s made a lot of money
in mines. I said to Edie: ‘I’ll shoot for the West
and locate a few and so attract his attention to
the Young Napoleon of mines in his own field.’ It
looked easy.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” whispered Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“But it wasn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course again,” and the girl smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Grin away. It helps <em>you</em> to bear it,” scoffed
Royal Phelps. “But it doesn’t help the ‘down and
outer’ a bit to grin. I know. I’ve tried it ever
since last fall.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“I finally got to rummaging out through these
hills. I came with a party of sheep herders. You
know the Prodigal Son only herded hogs. <em>That’s</em>
an aristocratic game out here in the West beside
sheep herding. Believe me!
</p>
<p>
“It puts a man in the last row when he fools
with sheep. When I went down to Yucca nobody
would have anything to do with me but old Braun.
And he was owning sheep right then.
</p>
<p>
“If I went into a place the fellows would hold
their noses and tiptoe out. You know, it’s a joke
out here: A couple of fellows made a bet as to
which was the most odoriferous—a sheep or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
Greaser. So they put up the money and selected
a judge.
</p>
<p>
“They brought the sheep into the judge’s cabin
and the judge fainted. Then they brought in the
Greaser and the sheep fainted. So, you see, aside
from Greasers, I didn’t have many what you’d call
close friends.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s lips formed the words “Poor boy!” but
she would not have given voice to them for the
world. Still, for some reason, Royal Phelps, who
was looking directly at her, nodded his head gratefully.
</p>
<p>
“Tough times, eh? Well, I’d seen something
up here in these hills. I’d been studying about
mineral deposits—especially gold signs. I saved
enough money to get a small outfit and this pony
I ride. I’d brought my gun on from the East. I
started out prospecting with scarcely a grubstake.
But nobody around here would have trusted a
tenderfoot like me. I was bound to do it on my
lonely, if I did it at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Weren’t you afraid to start off alone?” asked
Ruth. “Mr. Peters says it is dangerous for <em>one</em>
to go prospecting.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But lots of the old-timers do. And this
‘new-timer’ did it. Nothing bit me,” he added
dryly.
</p>
<p>
“So I came back here and knocked up this
cabin. Pretty good for ‘mamma’s baby boy,’ isn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
it?” and he laughed shortly. “That’s what some
of the Lazy C punchers called me when I first
came into their neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
“Well, mamma’s boy played a lone hand and
found that ledge of gold ore. For it is gold I
know. I had some specimens assayed.”
</p>
<p>
“So did we,” confessed Ruth, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
He scowled again. “You girls—movie actresses,
college girls, or whoever you are—are
likely to queer this whole business for me. Say!”
he added, “that one in the overalls isn’t an Ardmore
freshman, is she?”
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” laughed Ruth. “But she needs a
gold mine a good deal more than the rest of us
do.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—MORE OF IT</h2>
<p>
Royal Phelps continued very grave and silent
for a few moments after Ruth’s last statement.
Then he groaned.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it can’t be helped! None of you can
want that ledge of gold more than I do. That I
know. But, of course, your claims are perfectly
legitimate. It is a fact the men Edith will bring
out with her are under contract. I sent her to a
lawyer in Kingman who understands such things.
An agreement with the men covers all the claims
they may stake out on this certain ledge—dimensions
in contract, and all that. I wanted to start
the work, make a showing with reports of assayers
and all, then send it to a friend of mine in New
York who graduated from college last year and
went into his father’s brokerage shop, and he
would put shares in my mine on the market. With
the money, I hoped to develop and—Well! what’s
the use of talking about it? We’ll get our little
slice and that is all, if you girls and the other folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
that have staked claims hang on to your ownings.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me how you came to get Edith into it?”
asked Ruth without commenting upon his statement.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she’s a good old sport, Edie is,” declared
the brother warmly. “She stood up to the
pater for me. She can do most anything with him.
But I’ve got to do something before he lets down
the bars to me, even for her sake.
</p>
<p>
“We kept in correspondence, Edie and I, all
through the winter. When I found this gold I
wrote her hotfoot. I did not dare file my claim.
It would cause comment and perhaps start a rush
this way.”
</p>
<p>
“I see.”
</p>
<p>
“And you can easily understand,” he chuckled,
“how startled Edie was when, as she told me, she
learned that several girls she knew were coming
out here to old Freezeout to work with some
movie people. Of course, she did not tell me just
who you were, Miss Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose not.”
</p>
<p>
“No. Well, she was suspicious of you, she
said. Wanted to know just when you were coming
and how. She desired to get to Yucca as soon
as possible, but she had to spend some time with
the pater. Poor old chap! he thinks the world
and all of her—in his way.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she had to do some shopping in New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
York, and went to a friend’s house. The chauffeur
who drove them around was a decent fellow
and she told him to keep a watch on the Delorphion
for you folks. You went there, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Ruth, remembering
Tom’s story.
</p>
<p>
“So did she—for one night. She took the same
train you did and an accident gave her some advantage.
I don’t think she was nice to that friend
of yours that she made tag on with her as far as
Handy, where I met her,” added Royal Phelps,
slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” was Ruth’s dry comment.
</p>
<p>
“But she was mighty secretive, you know,”
apologized the young man. “You see, we really
had to be.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s about all. Edie brought the
money. She has some of her own and the pater
gave her five thousand without asking a question.
She and I are really partners. We’re going to
show him—if we can.”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is fine of you, Mr. Phelps!” cried
Ruth, with enthusiasm. “And—and I think your
sister is a sister worth having.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you can bet she is!” he agreed. “Edie is
all right. I couldn’t begin to pull this off if it
were not for her. I expect the pater will say so
in the end. But if I can show some money for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
what I have done—a bunch of it—it will be all
right with him.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth made no further comment here. She saw
plainly that Royal Phelps’ father probably
weighed everybody and everything on the same
scales upon which precious metals are weighed.
</p>
<p>
“Now I’ll catch your pony, Mr. Phelps,” she
said. “If you want to ride back with me I’ll introduce
you to the girls and Miss Cullam.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s nice of you. Perfectly bully, you know.
Or, as they say out here, ‘skookum!’ But I guess
I’d better wait till Edie returns. Let her do the
honors. Besides, I am not at all sure that we
sha’n’t be enemies, Miss Fielding—worse luck.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Mr. Phelps,” Ruth said warmly.
“Never <em>that!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” he grumbled, hobbling on his
crutches now while she walked toward the pony
that was trailing his picket-rope. “You see, I’m
pretty desperate about this gold strike. I’ve a
good mind to go up there on the ridge and pull
up all your stakes and throw ’em away.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t,” she advised, smiling at him.
“Mr. Flapjack Peters has what they call a ‘sudden’
temper; and his daughter, we found out coming
over from Yucca, is a dead shot.”
</p>
<p>
“I want a big slice of that ledge,” said the young
man, sighing. “Enough to make a showing in the
Eastern share market.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let us wait and see. You know, you might be
able to buy up us girls—three of us who hold the
next three claims to yours and your sister’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Would you do it?” he demanded, brightening
up.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. And we might wait for our money
till you got the mine to working on a paying basis,”
Ruth said seriously. “Besides, there is Min
Peters and her father. If you would take them
into your company, so that they would have an
income, Peters would be of great use to you,
Mr. Phelps.”
</p>
<p>
“Look here! I’ll do anything fair,” cried the
young man. “It isn’t that I am just after the
money for the money’s sake——”
</p>
<p>
“I understand,” she told him, nodding. “We’ll
talk about it later. After we get reports on the
ore that Peters took specimens of, all along the
ledge. But I am afraid your sister’s bringing
workmen up here will start a stampede to Freezeout.”
</p>
<p>
“What do we care, as long as we get ours?” he
cried, cheerfully. “Whew! The pater may think
I am some good after all, before this business is
over.”
</p>
<p>
They mounted their ponies and rode to the
camp. They followed the very route Ruth had
come, but did not see the wounded wild horse
again. Royal Phelps left her when they came in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
sight of Freezeout and Ruth rode down into the
camp alone.
</p>
<p>
She told the camp wrangler something about
her adventure and the next day he went out with
some of the Indians and punchers working for the
outfit, and they ran down the black and white stallion.
</p>
<p>
However, Ruth had less interest in the wild
stallion than she had in several other subjects.
She quietly told the girls and Miss Cullam now
about the possible discovery of a rich gold-bearing
ledge so near camp. The Ardmore’s were naturally
greatly excited.
</p>
<p>
“Stingy!” cried Trix Davenport. “Why not
tell us all before?”
</p>
<p>
“Because those who found it had first rights,”
Ruth said gravely. “I <em>did</em> stake out a claim for
Rebecca. And I think Miss Cullam comes next.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, girls! <em>Real gold?</em>” gasped the teacher,
while Rebecca was speechless with amazement.
</p>
<p>
There was certainly a small “rush” that evening
for the gold-bearing ledge. Miss Cullam staked
her claim and put up a notice next to Rebecca
Frayne. All the other Ardmore’s followed suit;
even Ann Hicks was bitten by the fever of gold
seeking.
</p>
<p>
They must have been watched, for not a few
of the actors began to stake out claims as best they
knew how and put up notices on the outskirts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
the line along the summit of the ridge followed
by those first to know of the gold.
</p>
<p>
The Western men, the teamsters and others,
laughed at the whole business and tried to tease
Flapjack Peters; but they could get nothing out
of him. Then some of them saw samples of the
ore. The next morning found Freezeout Camp
almost abandoned. Everybody who had not already
done so was prowling around that half mile
ridge of land, trying to stake claims as near to the
top of the ledge as he could.
</p>
<p>
“And at that,” Min said gloomily, “some of
these fellers that caught on last may have the best
of it. We don’t know where the richest ore is
yet.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hammond and his director were nearly beside
themselves. That day the company was so
distraught that not a foot of film was made.
</p>
<p>
“How can I tell these crazy gold hunters how
to act like <em>real</em> gold hunters?” growled Grimes.
</p>
<p>
“If other people come flocking in the whole
thing will be ruined,” groaned Mr. Hammond.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding did not believe that. She began
to get a vision of what a real gold rush might
mean. If they could get a <em>bona fide</em> stampede on
the film she believed it would add a hundred per
cent. to the value of “The Forty-Niners.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE REAL THING</h2>
<p>
Freezeout Camp had awakened. Many of
the old shacks and cabins had been repaired and
made habitable for the purposes of the moving
picture company. The largest dance hall—“The
Palace of Pleasure” as it was called on the film—was
just as Flapjack Peters remembered it, back
in an earlier rush for placer gold to this spot.
</p>
<p>
Behind the rough bar, on the shelves, however,
were only empty bottles, or, at most, those filled
with colored water. Mr. Hammond had been
careful to keep liquor out of the rejuvenated camp.
</p>
<p>
Flapjack Peters began to look like a different
man. Whether it was his enforced abstinence
from drink, or the fact that he saw ahead the possibility
of wealth and the tall hat and white vest of
which he had dreamed, he walked erect and looked
every man straight in the eye.
</p>
<p>
“It gets me!” said Min to Ruth Fielding. “Pop
ain’t looked like this since I kin remember.”
</p>
<p>
Two days of this excitement passed. The motion picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
people “were getting down to earth
again,” as Mr. Grimes said, and the girls were
beginning to expect Tom Cameron’s return, when
one noon the head of a procession was seen advancing
through the nearest pass in the mountain
range to the west. As Ruth and others watched,
the procession began to wind down into the shallow
gorge where the long “petered-out” placer
diggings of Freezeout had been located, and where
the rejuvenated town itself still stood.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun can these people want?”
gasped Mr. Hammond, the president of the
film-making company, to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill was in riding habit
and she had her pony near at hand. “I’ll ride up
and see,” she said.
</p>
<p>
But the instant she had sighted the first group
of hurrying riders and the first wagon, she believed
she understood. Word of the “strike” at
the old camp had in some way become noised
abroad.
</p>
<p>
Before Edith Phelps and the men she was to
hire, with the Kingman lawyer’s aid, reached the
ledge her brother had located, other people had
heard the news. These were the first of “the gold
rush.”
</p>
<p>
She spurred her horse up into the pass and ran
the pony half a mile before she turned him and
raced back to Mr. Hammond. She came with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
flying hair and rosy cheeks to the worried president,
bursting with an idea that had assailed her
mind.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Hammond! It is the greatest sight you
ever saw! Get the camera man and hurry right
up there to the mouth of the pass. Tell Mr.
Grimes——”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” snapped the president of
the Alectrion Film Corporation. “Do you want
to disorganize my whole company again?”
</p>
<p>
“I want to show you the greatest moving picture
that ever was taken!” cried the girl of the Red
Mill. “Oh, Mr. Hammond, you <em>must</em> take it!
It must be incorporated in this film. Why! <em>it is the
real thing!</em>”
</p>
<p>
“What is that? A joke?” he growled.
</p>
<p>
“No joke at all, I assure you,” said Ruth, patiently.
“You can see them coming through the
pass—and beyond—for miles and miles. Men
afoot, on horseback, in all kinds of wagons, on
burros—oh, it is simply great! There are hundreds
and hundreds of them. Why, Mr. Hammond!
this Freezeout Camp is going to be a city
before night!”
</p>
<p>
The chief reason why Mr. Hammond was a
wealthy man and one of the powers in the motion
picture world was because he could seize upon a
new idea and appreciate its value in a moment.
He knew that Ruth was a sane girl and that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
had judgment, as well as imagination. He gaped
at her for a moment, perhaps; the next he was
shouting for Mr. Grimes, for the camera men, for
the horse wrangler, and for the “call-boy” to
round up the company.
</p>
<p>
In half an hour a train set out for the pass,
which met the first of the advance guard of gold
seekers pouring down into the valley. The eager-faced
men of all ages and apparently of all walks
in life hurried on almost silently toward the spot
where they were told a ledge of free gold had been
found.
</p>
<p>
There were roughly dressed teamsters, herdsmen,
nondescripts; there were Mexicans and Indians;
there were well dressed city men—lawyers,
doctors, other professional men, perhaps. Afterward
Ruth read in an Arizona newspaper that
such a typical stampede to any new-found gold or
silver strike had not been seen in a decade.
</p>
<p>
A camera man set up his machine in a good spot
and waited for the whole film company to drift
along into the pass and join the real gold seekers
that streamed down toward Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
This idea of Ruth Fielding’s was the crowning
achievement of her work on this film. The company
came back to the cabins at evening, wearied
and dust-choked, to find, as Ruth had prophesied,
a veritable city on and near the creek.
</p>
<p>
The newcomers had rushed into the hills and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
staked out their claims, some of them on the very
fringe of the valley out of which the gold-bearing
ledge rose. Of course, many of these claims
would be worthless.
</p>
<p>
A lively buying and selling of the more worthless
claims was already under way. With the
stampede had come storekeepers and wagons of
foodstuffs.
</p>
<p>
That night nobody slept. Mr. Hammond, realizing
what this really meant, but feeling none of
the itch for digging gold that most of those on the
spot experienced, organized a local constabulary.
A justice of the peace was found with intelligence
enough, and enough knowledge of the state ordinance,
to act as magistrate.
</p>
<p>
The men were called together early in the morning
in the biggest dance hall and the vast majority—indeed,
it was almost unanimous—voted that
liquor selling be tabooed at Freezeout.
</p>
<p>
Several men of unsavory reputations who had
come, like buzzards scenting the carrion from
afar, were advised to leave town and stay away.
They met other men of their stripe on the trail
from Handy Gulch and other such places, and reported
that Freezeout was going to be run “on a
Sunday-school basis”; there was nothing in it for
the usual birds of prey that infest such camps.
</p>
<p>
In a few hours the party coming from Kingman
with Edith Phelps and the lawyer she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
engaged, arrived. The camp about the ridge grew
and expanded in every direction. Most of the
claimholders slept on their claims, fearing trickery.
Shafts were sunk. The Phelps crowd began
to set up a small crusher and cyaniding plant that
had been trucked over the trails.
</p>
<p>
The moving picture was finished at last, before
either Mr. Grimes or Mr. Hammond quite lost
their minds. Several of the men of the company
broke their contract with the Alectrion Film Corporation
and would remain at the diggings. They
believed their claims were valuable.
</p>
<p>
Tom had returned before this with reports from
the assayer and copies of the filing of the claims.
The specimen from Ruth’s claim showed one hundred
and eighty dollars to the ton. The ore from
Flapjack Peters and Min’s claims were, after all,
the richest of any of their party, though farther
down the ledge. The ore taken from those claims
showed two hundred dollars to the ton.
</p>
<p>
“We’re rich—or we’re goin’ to be,” Min declared
to the Ardmore girls and Miss Cullam, the
last night the Eastern visitors were to remain in
Freezeout. “That lawyer of R’yal Phelps is goin’
to let pop have some money and we’re both goin’
to send for clo’es—some duds! Wish you could
wait and see me togged up just like a Fourth o’
July pony in the parade.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could, Min!” cried Jennie Stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“You shall come East to visit me later,” Ruth
declared. “Won’t you, Min? We’ll all show you
a good time there.”
</p>
<p>
“As though you hadn’t showed me the best time
I ever had already,” choked the Yucca girl. “But
I’ll come—after I git used to my new clo’es.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you and your father really made a bargain
with Royal Phelps?” Miss Cullam asked, as
much interested in the welfare of the suddenly enriched
girl as her pupils.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Ma’am. Pop’s going to have an office in
the new company, too. And Mr. Phelps is goin’
to git backin’ from the East and buy up all the
adjoinin’ claims that he can.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll have all ours, in time,” said Helen.
“That’s lots better than each of us trying to develop
her little claim. Oh, that Phelps man is
smart.”
</p>
<p>
“And what about Edith?” demanded the honest
Ruth. “We’ve got to praise her, too.”
</p>
<p>
There was silence. Finally, Miss Cullam said
dryly: “She seems to have no very enthusiastic
friends in the audience, Miss Fielding.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well,” Ruth said, laughing, “we none of
us like Edith.”
</p>
<p>
“How about liking her brother?” asked Jennie
Stone, and she seemed to say it pointedly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—UNCLE JABEZ IS CONVERTED</h2>
<p>
It was some months afterward. The growing
town of Cheslow had long since developed the
moving picture fever, and two very nice theatres
had been built.
</p>
<p>
One evening in the largest of these theatres
an old, gray-faced and grim-looking man sat beside
a very happy, pretty girl and watched the running
off of the seven-reel feature, “The Forty-Niners.”
</p>
<p>
If the old man came in under duress and
watched the first flashes on the screen with scorn,
he soon forgot all his objections and sat forward
in his seat to watch without blinking the scenes
thrown, one after another, on the sheet.
</p>
<p>
It really was a wonderfully fine picture. And
thrilling!
</p>
<p>
“Hi mighty!” ejaculated Uncle Jabez Potter,
unwillingly enough and under his breath in the
middle of the picture, “d’ye mean to say you done
all that, Niece Ruth?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
“I helped,” said Ruth, modestly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s as natcheral as the stepstun, I swan!”
gasped the miller. “I can ‘member hearin’ many
of the men that went out there in the airly days
tell about what it was like. This is jest like they
said it was. I don’t see how ye did it—an’ you
was never born even, when them things was like
that.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that, Uncle Jabez,” Ruth declared.
“For I saw a little bit of the real thing. They
write me that Freezeout Camp has taken on a new
lease of life. Mr. Phelps says,” and she blushed
a little, but it was dark and nobody saw it, “that
we are all going to make a lot of money out of
the Freezeout Ledge.”
</p>
<p>
But Uncle Jabez Potter was not listening. He
was enthralled again in the picture of old days
in the mining country. It seemed as though, at
last, the old miller was converted to the belief that
his grand-niece knew a deal more than he had
given her credit for. To his mind, that she knew
how to make money was the more important thing.
</p>
<p>
The final flash of the film reflected on the screen
passed and Uncle Jabez and Ruth rose to go. It
was dark in the theatre and the girl led the old
man out by the hand. Somehow he clung to her
hand more tightly than was usually his custom.
</p>
<p>
“’Tis a wonderful thing, Niece Ruth, I allow,”
he said when they came out into the lamplight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
Cheslow’s main street. “I—I dunno. You young
folks seems ter have got clean ahead of us older
ones. There’s things that I ain’t never hearn tell
of, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth Fielding laughed. “Why, Uncle Jabez,”
she said, “the world is just full of such a number
of things that neither of us knows much about that
that’s what makes it worth living in.”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno; I dunno,” he muttered. “Guess
you’ve got to know most of ’em now you’ve gone
to that college.”
</p>
<p>
“I am beginning to get a taste of some of them,”
she cried. “You know I have three more years
to spend at Ardmore before I can take a degree.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Wal, it don’t re’lly seem as though
knowin’ so <em>much</em> did a body any good in this
world. I hev got along on what little they
knocked inter my head at deestrict school. And
I’ve made a livin’ an’ something more. But I
never could write a movin’ picture scenario, that’s
true. And if there’s so much money in ’em——”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Hammond writes me that he’s sure there
is going to be a lot of money in this one. The
State rights are bringing the corporation in thousands.
Of course, my share is comparatively
small; but I feel already amply paid for my six
weeks spent in Arizona.”
</p>
<p>
This, however, is somewhat ahead of the story.
Uncle Jabez’ conversion was bound to be a slow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
process. When the party returned from the West
the person gladdest to see Ruth Fielding was Aunt
Alvirah.
</p>
<p>
The strong and vigorous girl was rather
shocked to find the little old woman so feeble.
She did not get around the kitchen or out of doors
nearly as actively as had been her wont.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my back! an’ oh, my bones! Seems ter
me, my pretty,” she said, sinking into her rocking
chair, “that things is sort o’ slippin’ away from
me. I feel that I am a-growin’ lazy.”
</p>
<p>
“Lazy! You couldn’t be lazy, Aunt Alvirah,”
laughed the girl of the Red Mill.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; I ‘spect I could,” said Aunt Alvirah,
nodding. “This here M’lissy your uncle’s hired
to help do the work, is a right capable girl. And
she’s made me lazy. If I undertake ter do a thing,
she’s there before me an’ has got it done.”
</p>
<p>
“You need to sit still and let others do the work
now,” Ruth urged.
</p>
<p>
“I dunno. What good am I to Jabez Potter?
He didn’t take me out o’ the poorhouse fifteen
year or more ago jest ter sit around here an’ play
lady. No, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty!”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno but I’d better be back there.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better not let Uncle Jabez hear you say
so,” Ruth cried. “Maybe I don’t always know
just how Uncle Jabez feels about me; but I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
how he looks at <em>you</em>, Aunt Alvirah. Don’t dare
suggest leaving the Red Mill.”
</p>
<p>
The little old woman looked at her steadily, and
there were the scant tears of age in the furrows
of her face.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be leavin’ it some day soon, my pretty.
’Tis a beautiful place here—the Red Mill. But
there is a Place Prepared. I’m on my way there,
Ruthie. But, thanks be, I kin cling with one hand
to the happy years here because of you, while my
other hand’s stretched out for the feel of a Hand
that you can’t see, my pretty. After all, Ruthie,
no matter how we live, or what we do, our livin’
is jest a preparation for our dyin’.”
</p>
<p>
Nor was this lugubrious. Aunt Alvirah was no
long-visaged, unhappy creature. The other girls
loved to call on her. Helen was at the Red Mill
this summer quite as much as ever. Jennie Stone
and Rebecca Frayne both visited Ruth after their
return from Freezeout Camp.
</p>
<p>
It was a cheerful and gay life they led. There
much much chatter of the happenings at Freezeout,
and of the work at the new gold mining camp.
Min Peters’ scrawly letters were read and re-read;
her pertinent comments on all that went on were
always worth reading and were sometimes actually
funny.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“I wish you could see pop,” she wrote once. “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
mean Mr. Henry James Peters. If ever there
was a big toad in a little puddle, it’s him!
</p>
<p>
“He’s got a hat so shiny that it dazzles you
when he’s out in the sun. It’s awful uncomfortable
for him to wear, I know. But he wouldn’t
give it up—nor the white vest and the dinky patent
leather shoes he’s got on right now—for all
the gold you could name.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m getting as bad. I sit around in a
flowery gown, and there’s a girl come here to work
in the hotel that’s trimming my nails and fixing my
hands up something scandalous. Man-curing, she
calls it.
</p>
<p>
“But the fine clothes has made another man of
pop; and I expect they’ll improve yours truly a
whole lot. When we get real used to them, sometime
we’ll come East and see you. I can pretty
near trust pop already to go into a rumhole here
without expecting to see him come out again orey-eyed.
</p>
<p>
“Not that he’s shown any dispersition to drink
again. He says his position is too important in
the Freezeout Ledge Gold Mining Company for
any foolishness. And I’ll tell you right now, he’s
the only member of the company now that that
Edie girl’s gone home that ever is dressed up on
the job. Mr. Phelps works like as though he’d
been used to it all his life.
</p>
<p>
“Let me tell you. <em>His</em> pop’s been out here to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
see him. ‘Looking over prospects’ he called it.
But you bet you it was to see what sort of a figure
his son was cutting here among sure-enough men.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon the old gentleman was satisfied. I
seen them riding over the hills together, as well as
wandering about the diggings. One night while
he was here we had a big dance—a regular hoe-down—in
the big hall.
</p>
<p>
“This here big-bug father of Mr. Royal danced
with me. What do you know about that? ‘What
do you think of my son?’ says he to me while we
was dancing.
</p>
<p>
“Says I: ‘I think he’s got almost as much sense
as though he was borned and brought up in Arizona.
And he knows a whole lot more than most
of our boys does.’ ‘Why,’ says he to me, ‘you’ve
got a lot of good sense yourself, ain’t you?’ I
guess Mr. Royal had been cracking me up to his
father at that.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Phelps—the younger, I mean—takes dinner
with us most every Sunday; and he treats me
just as nice and polite as though I’d been used to
having my hair done up and my hands man-cured
all my life.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
This letter arrived at the Red Mill on a day
when Jennie and Rebecca were there, as well as
Helen and her twin. There was more to Min
Peters’ long epistle; but as Jennie Stone said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough to show how the wind is blowing.
Why, I had no idea that Phelps boy would
ever show such good sense as to ‘shine up’ to
Min!”
</p>
<p>
“The dear girl!” sighed Ruth. “She has the
making of a fine woman in her. I don’t blame
Royal Phelps for liking her.”
</p>
<p>
“I imagine Edie took back a long tale of woe to
her father and that he went out there to ‘look
over’ Min more than he did gold prospects,” Rebecca
said, tartly. “Of course, she’s awfully uncouth,
and Royal Phelps is a gentleman——”
</p>
<p>
“Thus speaks the oracle!” exclaimed Helen,
briskly. “Rebecca believes in putting signs on the
young men of our best families who go into such
regions: ‘Beware the dog.’”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he is really nice,” complained Rebecca,
who could not easily be cured of snobbishness.
</p>
<p>
“I hope there are others,” announced Tom,
swinging idly in the hammock.
</p>
<p>
“Fishing for compliments, I declare,” laughed
Jennie, poking him.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he’s des the cutest, nicest ‘ittle sing,”
cooed his sister, rocking the big fellow in the hammock.
</p>
<p>
“It’s been an awful task for you to bring him
up, Nell,” drawled Jennie. “But after all, I don’t
know but it’s been worth while. He’s almost
human. If they’d drowned him when he was little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
and only raised you, I don’t know but it would
have been a calamity.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, cat’s foot!” snapped Tom, rising from the
hammock with a bound. “You girls mostly give
me a woful pain. You’re too biggity. Pretty soon
there won’t be any comfort living in the world with
you ‘advanced women.’ The men will have to go
off to another planet and start all over again.
</p>
<p>
“Who’ll mend your socks and press your neckties?”
laughed Ruth from her seat on the piazza
railing.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be! If there are no women the necessity
for ties and socks will be done away with.
And certain sure most of you college girls will
never know how to do either.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear him!” cried Jennie.
</p>
<p>
“Infamous!” gasped Rebecca.
</p>
<p>
“You wait, young man,” laughed his sister.
“I’ll make you pay for that.”
</p>
<p>
But Tom recovered his temper and grinned at
them. Then he glanced up at Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Come on down, Ruth, and take a walk, will
you? Come off your perch.”
</p>
<p>
The girl of the Red Mill laughed at him; but
she did as he asked. “Come on, I’m game.”
</p>
<p>
“No more walks,” groaned Jennie. “I scarcely
cast a shadow now I’m getting so thin. That saddle
work in Arizona pulled me down till I’m
scarcely bigger than a thread of cotton.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Tom started off to go along the river
road, the two who had first been friends in Cheslow
and around the Red Mill. There was a smile
on Ruth’s lips; but Tom looked serious. Neither
of them dreamed of the strenuous adventures the
future held in store for them, as will be related in
our next volume, entitled “Ruth Fielding in the
Red Cross; or, Doing Her Bit for Uncle Sam.”
</p>
<p>
The other young folks, remaining in the shaded
farmyard, looked after them. Jennie jerked out:
</p>
<p>
“Mighty—nice—looking—couple, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Nobody made any rejoinder, but all three of
Ruth’s friends gazed after her and her companion.
</p>
<p>
The couple had halted on the bridge. They
were talking earnestly, and Ruth rested one hand
on the railing and turned to face the young man.
His big brown hand covered hers, that lay on the
rail. Ruth did not withdraw it.
</p>
<p>
“Mated!” drawled Jennie Stone, and the others
nodded understandingly.

<p>
This new series of girls’ books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in knowing
the girls and seeing them solve the problems
that develop their character. Incidentally, a
great deal of historical information is imparted.
</p>
<p>
<b>1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE</b>
<em>or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</em>
</p>
<p>
How the Linger-Not girls met and formed
their club seems commonplace, but this
writer makes it fascinating, and how they
made their club serve a great purpose continues
the interest to the end, and introduces
a new type of girlhood.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE VALLEY FEUD</b>
<em>or The Great West Point Chain</em>
</p>
<p>
The Linger-Not girls had no thought of becoming mixed up with
feuds or mysteries, but their habit of being useful soon entangled

and made the valley better because of their visit.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST</b>
<em>or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</em>
</p>
<p>
For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold rush, seems unnatural until the
reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of their
friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms a fine
story.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE WHISPERING CHARMS</b>
<em>or The Secret from Old Alaska</em>
</p>
<p>
Whether engrossed in thrilling adventures in the Far North or
occupied with quiet home duties, the Linger-Not girls could work
unitedly to solve a colorful mystery in a way that interpreted
American freedom to a sad young stranger, and brought happiness
to her and to themselves.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
